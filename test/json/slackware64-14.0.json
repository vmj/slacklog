(CVE-2017-16612)\n  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow\n  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\n  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for\n  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\n  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16612\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

As of version\n  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)\n  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,\n  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and\n  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system\n  after the upgrade.\n  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes\n  to be aware of:\n  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by\n    default at compile time.\n  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange\n    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using\n    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html\n  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled\n    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the\n    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html\n  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.\n  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has\n    changed from \"yes\" to \"prohibit-password\".\n  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all\n    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,\n    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted\n    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those\n    were enabled).\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

An error in the implementation of this\n  logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted\n  certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a\n  valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and \"issue\" an invalid certificate.\n  This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including\n  SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.\n  This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o.\n  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 24th June 2015 by Adam Langley/David\n  Benjamin (Google/BoringSSL).

This could be\n    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.\n  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):\n    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the\n    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session\n    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory\n    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session\n    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\n    attack.\n  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:\n    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications\n    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol\n    downgrade.\n    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a\n    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older\n    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to\n    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection\n    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses\n    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).\n  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):\n    When OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers\n    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\n    configured to send them.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

Here's some information included with the patch:\n    \"This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid\n    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment\n    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell\n    function.\"\n  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser\n  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%\n  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,\n  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break\n  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as\n  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another\n  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,\n  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).\n  Thanks to Florian Weimer and Chet Ramey.\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

                    "description": "  Upgraded.\n  Well, udev in this devel cycle has certainly been interesting!  A fair\n  number of odd bug reports have been coming in, and we hadn't really been\n  able to get a handle on the source of the issues.  Quite some time ago\n  we started testing udev-182, and noticed that it caused some issues with\n  the persistent net and cd rules.  There'd sometimes be two entries per\n  device, so a machine with a single Ethernet card might come up showing the\n  card as eth1, with two rules in 70-persistent-net.rules (eth0 and eth1).\n  We tested a lot of udev versions trying to determine where the problem\n  started, and it seemed to begin with version 176, the first one that\n  used libkmod rather than calling out to module-init-tools to load modules.\n  Asking upstream about it, they suggested that we just turn the generation\n  of persistent rules off.  They'd already turned it off by default.  \"Make\n  'em make rules!\" seemed to be the answer, and since I remember well why\n  the autogeneration of net and CD rules came about, I wasn't really happy\n  with that answer.  After deploying the \"safe\" upgrade to 175, we got a\n  couple of reports of this same issue happening (though none of us could\n  reproduce the issue with 175).  Robby ended up making some patches to\n  the rule writing scripts for udev-182 that were able to stop the doubling\n  up of rules, but the devices themselves would still be misnumbered on the\n  first boot without rules, and would then be correct after a reboot.\n    Last week I sat down determined to figure out where the race condition\n  was.  After endless reboots with various tests, I got the idea to put my\n  network modules on the initrd and have it shell out so that I could take\n  a look at them.  What I found was that the rules were generated correctly\n  on the initrd.  Well, that was a surprise, but I must have had some kind\n  of hunch to even try a test like that.  On another hunch, I ran\n  \"pstree -c -p | grep udevd\" on the running system.  Heh.  There it was.\n  We had been running two copies of udevd, and they were fighting it out.\n  At some point along the line, udevd was changed.  It used to be that if\n  you tried to start a second copy it wouldn't start, and would exit with\n  status 1, and our rc.udev script relied on this behavior.  Fixing the\n  problem was considerably easier than finding it...  rworkman and I made\n  some changes in rc.udev to check if udevd was already running instead\n  of expecting it to check for itself.  Another change was required to\n  cause it to write out rules if they didn't exist already, and then to\n  read them back in (otherwise optical symlinks were still missing on first\n  boot without rules).  There's still one issue that was also present with\n  udev-175, which is that a hotplugged optical drive won't get symlinks\n  unless it has been in at boot and had rules generated for it then.\n  Otherwise, things are looking considerably better.  Firmware is loading\n  correctly, rules are autogenerated properly again, and several devices\n  that were missing in /dev have returned.\n    So, there's the story.  Maybe more than you really wanted to know.  ;-)\n  Thanks to rworkman for his help on this.  Please report any new problems.\n  And if anyone knows how to get symlinks working for a hotplugged optical\n  drive like they did in udev-165, a fix would be most appreciated.\n",

A few notes are in order here...   first, we've\nswitched to using openssl-1.0.1c, which changes the major number for the\ncrypto and ssl libraries from .0 to .1, meaning everything linked with the\nprevious version of openssl will need to be recompiled.  The\nlib{crypto,ssl}.so.0 libraries were backed up into aaa_elflibs, but this only\nmeans that binaries linked with those libraries will start, not that SSL will\ncontinue to work for them.  The hashing format in /etc/ssl/certs/ has changed,\nso any programs linking to the old libraries will not be able to use them.\nNext, Java has gone away due to licensing restrictions...  Finally, these\nchanges have broken Xfce as it exists in -current at the moment, but I'll try\nto do something about that soon.  Thanks to Robby Workman and Eric Hameleers\nfor lots of help on these updates!\n",

This change disallows building the QLogic 40xx\n  (ISP4XXX) and 8022 (ISP82XX) into the huge kernel, but for the same reason\n  those would not have worked for installation anyway.\n  CONFIG_BCMA was turned off because including it prevents building the\n  Broadcom BRCMSMAC driver, which is the only working choice for several\n  adapters other than the proprietary wl driver.  Unfortunately, removing\n  BCMA removes support for bcm4331 from the b43 driver.  However, adding the\n  BRCMSMAC causes several new adaptors to gain support, including some that\n  are becoming quite common in recent laptops, so overall this change should\n  be a net gain.\n",

SANE\n  would come along and switch the group on multifunction printer/scanners\n  to \"scanner\", and then CUPS would no longer be able to use them.  The\n  kernel module wasn't affected by this since it didn't use the raw USB\n  device node and didn't care who owned it.  Anyway, making this switch\n  gets things pretty close to how they were before.  The good news is that\n  printers should be detected and configurable without having to look at\n  lsusb output or writing custom udev rules, however, users will need to\n  be in group lp in order to use the scanner.

Systems older\n  than that can still be upgraded to -current (or Slackware-next) and will\n  work fine using megaraid.ko and an appropriate initrd (we will still\n  provide the legacy module for the generic kernel).  Hopefully this\n  inconvenience will not affect too many users, but a choice needed to be\n  made in the installer one way or the other, and it seemed better to support\n  new cards than obsolete ones.\n",
