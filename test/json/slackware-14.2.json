(CVE-2017-16612)\n  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow\n  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\n  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for\n  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\n  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16612\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

The theoretical attack vector is a hostile DHCP server providing a\n  crafted hostname, but this is unlikely to occur in a normal Slackware\n  configuration as we ignore the hostname provided by DHCP.\n  Specially crafted SHELLOPTS+PS4 environment variables used against bogus\n  setuid binaries using system()/popen() allowed local attackers to execute\n  arbitrary code as root.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0634\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7543\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

The new release brings many updates\nand modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds\nwell over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the\nupstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else\nwho pitched in to help make this release a reality.\n\nThe ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided\n32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware\nproject by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking\npre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.\n\nHave fun!  :-)\n",

That seemingly\n  smart thing had some serious unintended consequences.  One typical issue was\n  that when unplugging headphones, PulseAudio might switch to S/PDIF output\n  and not switch back to headphones when they are plugged in again.  Another\n  issue was that HDMI in many cases appears to get temporarily unplugged when\n  the monitor goes to sleep mode, or even when switching the refresh rate of\n  the monitor -- PulseAudio 8.0 would move audio away from the HDMI monitor in\n  these cases and not move the audio back to HDMI when the monitor becomes\n  available again.  These issues are now fixed.\"\n",

            "description": "Hey folks, happy new year!\nAfter upgrading to BlueZ 5 recently, everything seemed to be working great,\nbut then it was pointed out that Bluetooth audio was no longer working.\nThe reason was that the newer BlueZ branch had dropped ALSA support and now\nrequired PulseAudio.  So with some trepidation, we began investigating adding\nPulseAudio to Slackware.  Going back to BlueZ 4 wasn't an option with various\ndependent projects either having dropped support for it, or considering doing\nso.  After several iterations here refining the foundation packages and\nrecompiling and tweaking other packages to use PulseAudio, it's working well\nand you'll likely not notice much of a change.  But if you're using Bluetooth\naudio, or needing to direct audio through HDMI, you'll probably find it a lot\neasier to accomplish that.\nBest of all, we're finally a modern, relevant Linux distro!  ;-)\nThanks to Mario Preksavec, Heinz Wiesinger, and Robby Workman for a lot of\nhelp and testing.  Bug reports, complaints, and threats can go to me.\nAlso, enjoy a shiny new LTS 4.4.0 kernel and consider this 14.2 beta 1.\n",

Make sure you remove the old udev and install both of the\nnew packages (eudev and libgudev), and then the changeover to eudev should\ngo as smooth as silk.  Really, the icu4c upgrade seemed more disruptive.  :)\nA reboot after this is probably better than \"/etc/rc.d/rc.udev force-restart\",\nbut that worked fine here, too.  It would also be a good idea to regenerate\nthe initrd so that it uses eudev, but once again things worked fine here\neither way.  Have fun!\n",

Spaces in file\n  and directory names also work, so support should be complete.\n  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp.\n  Patched makepkg to ensure that the root of a package is chmod 755.\n  Patched installpkg to speed up several parts of the script, especially when\n  symlinks are created by an install script.  If bash is available, install\n  scripts will be translated to avoid spawning two subshells per link.\n  Also, reduced UUOC!  :-)\n  Patched removepkg to speed up several parts of the script.\n  Thanks to Stuart Winter and Jim Hawkins.\n  Patched upgradepkg to speed up several parts of the script by using native\n  bash rather than calling out to sed.  (Similar changes might be applied to\n  installpkg/removepkg in the future, but upgradepkg looping against the full\n  set of packages is where the most improvement is seen)\n  Thanks to Michal \"mina86\" Nazarewicz.\n",

Validating recursive\n  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not\n  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an\n  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers\n  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,\n  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to\n  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.\n  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.\n  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.\n  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used\n  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation\n  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk\n  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could\n  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under\n  limited conditions.\n  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to\n  CVE-2015-5986.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01287/0\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5722\n    https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01291/0\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5986\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

This could be\n    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.\n  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):\n    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the\n    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session\n    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory\n    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session\n    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\n    attack.\n  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:\n    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications\n    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol\n    downgrade.\n    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a\n    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older\n    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to\n    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection\n    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses\n    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).\n  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):\n    When OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers\n    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\n    configured to send them.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568\n  (* Security fix *)\n",
