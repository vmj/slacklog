I believe that the existing\n  order of unmounting non-root filesystems followed by remounting the root\n  filesystem as read-only is the correct order, and found that putting\n  another sync between these also gets rid of the error on shutdown, so I've\n  done that. When using JFS as the root filesystem there's still another\n  similar error message that's generated earlier in the boot, though. I'm\n  unable to find any way to shut down a JFS root partition in a way that\n  leaves it clean enough that fsck will not check it at boot, but it is always\n  found to be clean so this should only be cosmetic. I recall this behavior of\n  JFS going all the way back to when it was first added to the kernel.

This patch disables the new\n  behavior unless \"sysvinit_agetty\" is also seen in the kernel command line.\n  It seems like this might have been something added for Hurd, and it might\n  be wise to stick to what we've got rather than following upstream on this\n  particular package. If anyone notices any other odd behavior, please let\n  me know. Thanks to shastah.\n",

Originally reported by Matt Van Gundy of Cisco.\n    Edge-case hole reported by Martin Burnicki of Meinberg.\n  And fixes another security issue in ntpq and ntpdc:\n    LOW: Sec 3505: The openhost() function used during command-line hostname\n    processing by ntpq and ntpdc can write beyond its buffer limit, which\n    could allow  an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher\n    privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6\n    command-line parameter.

            "description": "Hey folks, my first order of business here needs to be a huge thank you to\neveryone who has donated at https://paypal.me/volkerdi to help keep this\nproject going. As most of you are already aware by now, the financal situation\nhere at Slackware HQ has not been great for many years, including not getting\nany pay for the last two years and forcing me (and my family) to live very\nfrugally while I continued to work on the project hoping I'd figure out a way\nto actually monitize it by the time that Slackware 15.0 is ready for release.\nI'm not trying to cast any blame regarding the situation. Really, I can only\nblame myself for not trying to build my own ship years ago when things began\nto not really work out. I'm still looking into sustainable funding options\nsuch as Patreon or Liberapay (or perhaps both), and I'm open to other ideas.\nI'm no longer in immediate danger of going broke, and I'm no longer\nentertaining the notion of joining my friends at the local potato chip factory\nin order to pay my bills. :) My family is grateful and humbled by the support\nwe've received. Hope we'll be able to keep this project going for a long time.\nAlso, I realize that the website lacks updates and needs attention and I will\nneed to find some time to devote to that. I've never been much of a website\ndesigner, and the slackware.com site is basically left over from work done by\nformer Walnut Creek / BSDi employees. I've never seen able to make much sense\nof the SQL backend. The interface to edit and post articles is clunky (and\nI'm not sure the PHP for that even works any more). When I've posted articles\nin recent years, I've done so by editing the main page already processed from\nPHP into HTML, which is pretty darn messy as I'm sure you can imagine. I tend\nto prioritize the distribution itself over other demands on my time - that's\nclearly a lot to do with how things ended up the way they did.\nSo, I guess that's the report for now. Lots more work to do and not enough\ntime to do it in... that part I don't see changing moving forward. :)\nThanks very much again. I'll do my best to keep you all posted.\n  - Pat\n",

When the original\nannouncement went out on Usenet, I believe it had a UTC timestamp which has\nled to some confusion over whether the anniversary falls on the 16th (which\nwas the date when I made the post) or on the 17th (which is when most people\nfirst saw it)... but really, what's the difference? We can celebrate on both\ndays as far as I'm concerned. Thanks for sticking with the project all these\nyears. Glad I was able to help. :)\nHere's a link to the 1.00 announcement:\n  http://www.slackware.com/announce/1.0.php\nAnd here's a nice article that was posted on opensource.com:\n  https://opensource.com/article/18/7/stackware-turns-25\n",

It's well-tested here, and works with the\n  slackpkg that's in -current now, but I don't know about slackpkg+ so that's\n  another reason to let it cool down here first. The purpose of this update\n  is to migrate the package database and directories from /var/log to\n  /var/lib/pkgtools. /var/log was never a good place for this data, as it is\n  considered by many to be a directory that could be wiped to free up some\n  space. Originally the package database was in /var/adm, but the FSSTND\n  (later FHS) group decided that directory should be a symlink to /var/log,\n  and I went along with that since it was years ago and I was a n00b and didn't\n  know any better. /var/lib/pkgtools will be a better and safer location.\n  The removed_packages and removed_scripts directories are really just logs\n  that aren't actually used for anything - those will remain under /var/log,\n  but moved into /var/log/pkgtools. Everything under /var/log will be\n  considered potentially non-permanent by the pkgtools - if any directories or\n  symlinks disappear from there, the pkgtools will automatically recreate them\n  as needed. In fact, the migration process will create symlinks from all the\n  old directory locations to the new ones, so anything that expects the old\n  locations (including slackpkg, for now) should continue to work. Once this\n  moves into the main tree, the plan is to fix other packages to use the new\n  installer script directory (/var/lib/pkgtools/setup) and change the installer\n  and slackpkg to use the new native locations for everything. When slackpkg\n  is changed over to use the new native locations, I'll also make sure to float\n  that in testing/ for a few days before moving it to the main tree to avoid\n  more unintentional disruption to slackpkg+ users.\n  Be aware that the package database migration is a one-way operation, but even\n  so if you later downgrade to an older version of the pkgtools it will still\n  work through the compatibility symlinks.\n",

            "description": "Don't like PulseAudio? Well... I hear you. Personally, it works for me, and it\nmakes it easier to switch between multiple audio inputs and outputs compared\nto using plain ALSA. PulseAudio got off to a rocky start in the Linux world,\nwhere it found itself adopted before it was ready (it was even billed on its\nown website at the time as \"the software that currently breaks your audio\").\nIt's my opinion that the reputation that PulseAudio acquired due to problems\nback then isn't deserved any longer. If your hardware supports the sampling\nrate of the audio data you're trying to play, PulseAudio will not resample it\n(and if your hardware doesn't support that rate, resampling can hardly be\navoided). The increased latency has not been an issue here. Nevertheless, I\nrecognize that there are use cases where PulseAudio is still a detriment.\nWhile I don't generally recommend removing PulseAudio, I'm not going to cram\nit down your throat. So, if you'd like to be rid of PulseAudio, head over to\nthe new extra/pure-alsa-system directory and follow the instructions in the\nREADME file there, and you'll have a PulseAudio-free pure ALSA system.\nThanks to orbea who sent me a small patch for the mpg123.SlackBuild so that\nit would detect the lack of PulseAudio and not try to build in support, which\ngot me to thinking about all of this. Cheers! :-)\n",

            "description": "Hi folks, and welcome to the third ever Slackware Mass Rebuild (and the\nlongest ChangeLog entry in project history). There were two primary\nmotivations for rebuilding everything in the main tree. The first was to\nswitch to the new C++ ABI. The second was to get rid of all the .la files\nin the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Really, having .la files installed has been mostly\nobsolete since things began to use pkg-config instead, but it's not easy\nto get rid of them unless you do it all at once. If you just take them out\nof one package, any other packages containing .la files that refer to the\nremoved ones will be broken. We've removed a few here and there before\n(and then handled any packages that had referred to them with a rebuild),\nbut it was time to finally remove all the ones in /lib{,64} and\n/usr/lib{,64}. One of the reasons that this really needed to happen is that\nmany projects are starting to migrate to build systems other than autotools,\nand those systems do not generate .la files. So if we didn't get rid of them\nnow, we might end up in a situation later on where they are being removed\nby upstream and then we would have to chase down the dependency breakage and\nrecompile (possibly many) other packages. The .la files that are outside of\nthe LD_LIBRARY_PATH were not removed (and shouldn't be) - those ones are\noften used by the lt_dlopen() function to load plugins and removing those\nones can break things. But those ones don't cause problems... they aren't\nlikely to try to infect .la files produced by other packages.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If you have any third party or other packages installed on\nyour system that don't come with Slackware, and those packages have installed\nany .la files, it is very likely that they refer to some .la files which we\nhave just removed, and that trying to compile against these packages will no\nlonger work. Luckily, the solution is simple: remove them. This command will\nremove any stale .la files from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\nrm /{,usr/}lib{,64}/*.la\nMoving forward, nothing shipped in Slackware will contain any .la files in\nthose directories, and any SlackBuilds intended to be used with Slackware 15.0\nshould contain this bit of script:\n# Don't ship .la files:\nrm -f $PKG/{,usr/}lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/*.la\nIn addition to those goals, the opportunity was taken to clean up slack-desc\nfiles and make many trivial fixes to build scripts. We've also made it easy\nto recompile everything again should there be a good reason to do so.\nYou'll also find various updates scattered throughout this long list.\nEnjoy, and sorry about the bandwidth. ;-)\n",

Missing input sanitization checks on some of the\n  input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the print spooler\n  service to crash. There is no known vulnerability associated with this\n  error, merely a denial of service. If the RPC spoolss service is left by\n  default as an internal service, all a client can do is crash its own\n  authenticated connection.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-1057.html\n    https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CVE-2018-1057\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1057\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1050\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

(CVE-2017-16612)\n  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow\n  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\n  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for\n  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\n  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16612\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA\n  and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and\n  are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible\n  (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce\n  information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of\n  resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely\n  only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would\n  additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target\n  private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private\n  key that is shared between multiple clients.\n  This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions\n  like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171102.txt\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

It's actually been deprecated for\n  a while and nothing has referenced in for quite some time.\n  Be sure to move the new rc.ntpd.new into place, and move over or merge\n  from the .new config files.\n  Thanks to Robby Workman for help with these changes.\n  In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes security\n  issues of medium and low severity:\n  Denial of Service via Malformed Config (Medium)\n  Authenticated DoS via Malicious Config Option (Medium)\n  Potential Overflows in ctl_put() functions (Medium)\n  Buffer Overflow in ntpq when fetching reslist from a malicious ntpd (Medium)\n  0rigin DoS (Medium)\n  Buffer Overflow in DPTS Clock (Low)\n  Improper use of snprintf() in mx4200_send() (Low)\n  The following issues do not apply to Linux systems:\n  Privileged execution of User Library code (WINDOWS PPSAPI ONLY) (Low)\n  Stack Buffer Overflow from Command Line (WINDOWS installer ONLY) (Low)\n  Data Structure terminated insufficiently (WINDOWS installer ONLY) (Low)\n  For more information, see:\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6464\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6463\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6458\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6460\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9042\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6462\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6451\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6455\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6452\n    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6459\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

The new release brings many updates\nand modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds\nwell over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the\nupstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else\nwho pitched in to help make this release a reality.\n\nThe ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided\n32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware\nproject by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.
