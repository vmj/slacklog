(CVE-2017-16612)\n  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow\n  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\n  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for\n  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\n  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16612\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would\n  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the\n  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works\n  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original\n  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the\n  user must provide --trust-server-names.\n  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by\n  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4971\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

As of version\n  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)\n  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,\n  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and\n  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system\n  after the upgrade.\n  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes\n  to be aware of:\n  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by\n    default at compile time.\n  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange\n    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using\n    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html\n  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled\n    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the\n    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html\n  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.\n  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has\n    changed from \"yes\" to \"prohibit-password\".\n  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all\n    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,\n    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted\n    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those\n    were enabled).\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

Servers\n  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,\n  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to\n  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.\n  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.\n  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.\n  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used\n  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.

However, all released\n  versions of Samba's AD DC did not implement the additional required\n  check on the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT bit in the userAccountControl\n  attributes.  Most Samba deployments are not of the AD Domain Controller,\n  but are of the classic domain controller, the file server or print server.\n  Only the Active Directory Domain Controller is affected by this issue.\n  Additionally, most sites running the AD Domain Controller do not configure\n  delegation for the creation of user or computer accounts, and so are not\n  vulnerable to this issue, as no writes are permitted to the\n  userAccountControl attribute, no matter what the value.\n  For more information, see:\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8143\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

This could be\n    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.\n  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):\n    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the\n    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session\n    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory\n    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session\n    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\n    attack.\n  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:\n    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications\n    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol\n    downgrade.\n    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a\n    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older\n    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to\n    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection\n    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses\n    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).\n  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):\n    When OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers\n    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\n    configured to send them.\n  For more information, see:\n    https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567\n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568\n  (* Security fix *)\n",

There's a new README_UEFI.TXT file with detailed\ninstructions for installing 64-bit Slackware on UEFI (32-bit won't\nsupport native UEFI due to the mismatch between 64-bit UEFI firmware and\na 32-bit kernel, so Legacy BIOS will be the only way to install 32-bit\nSlackware on UEFI).  Several useful netfilter and networking utilities\nhave been added (thanks to Robby Workman and /dev/rob0 for these).\nWith this batch of updates, everything should be considered frozen\n(including the kernel) unless there's a good reason to change something.\nEnjoy!

Thanks to mancha.\n  Note that while this patches CVE-2013-2207 (a local privilege escalation\n  vulnerability), the vulnerability depends upon insecure and non-default\n  settings (\"user_allow_other\" in /etc/fuse.conf) and the patch is not\n  trivial to port to older versions of glibc.  For older versions, the\n  best approach is to not set that option in fuse.conf, as it likely opens\n  up other holes as well.  Another approach to mitigate this is to make\n  pt_chown a symlink to /bin/true, as the kernel has handled chowning\n  pseudo terminals for a long time and pt_chown isn't needed at all.\n",

It should be\na nice improvement over 3.8.13, which as you all know has reached EOL (at\nkernel.org anyway...  I do know about Ubuntu's git maintained version).\nAfter the last experience with upgrading 14.0 to a newer LTS kernel, I can't\nsay that I have too much faith in the idea that LTS kernels can be upgraded\nwithout causing any regressions.  If the kernel we're using in -current\nhappens to be delared an LTS kernel, sure, that's a nice plus, but I don't\nthink it's worth rolling all the way back to 3.4.x just to have an LTS kernel.\nAnyway, test it out and report any issues!\n",

Even with all the fixes applied, the\n  new engine is grossly inefficient when compared with the old one, and it is\n  obvious that vim is running much more slowly even on my fastest machine.\n  It seems like the best course of action is to take all the patches before\n  the one that changed the regexp engine and then give upstream some time to\n  figure this all out.

            "description": "Hey folks, a few more updates are ready.  I'd like to thank everyone who\nweighed in on the thread on LQ concerning reverting a few things to more\nstable versions.  Your opinions were very helpful.  Here's what was\nconcluded after careful consideration:\n1) kernel:  Stick with 3.8 for now.  It remains a concern that the nVidia\n6150SE and nouveau could be broken with kernels above 3.6.1, however.\nDoes anyone know if the blob fixes the issues?  If not, there may still be\na compelling reason to switch to the 3.4 kernel for the release.  The\nrelease of the 3.9 kernel might be another reason as well, since moving to\na newer branch could bring more problems and would basically require testing\nto start again at square one (and then the 3.8 branch would be dead).  But\nsince we're sticking with 3.8 for now, might as well bump it to 3.8.8.\n2) gcc:  I really have not run into any compiler bugs with this.  There was\na single report of issues with the radeon R300 when the kernel was compiled\nwith 4.8.0, and it wasn't reported on any bug trackers or anywhere else.\nNone of the other reports of issues could be reproduced here, or were merely\na case of getting rid of -Werror.  I see no reason to downgrade this.\n3) xorg-server:  Here, it does appear that going with the better supported\nbranch (1.13.x) is a good idea to help support external drivers.  Many\npeople reported when the batch containing 1.14.0 was shipped that things were\nworking better, but I attribute this to the driver updates that went out at\nthe same time.  I've moved the 1.14.x (upgraded to 1.14.1) server and the\ndrivers that were build against it into testing, so anyone that wants to use\nthat branch is free to continue to do so.  But I think that the average user\nis more likely to run into problems with the 1.14.x branch and the lack of\ndriver support from AMD than they are to require one of the improvements such\nas in the area of touch input support.\nThanks again for the advice!\n",

This was caused by a\n  change in the behavior of glibc's crypt() function.  When a user that does\n  not exist tries to log in, the code in shadow calls crypt() with an invalid\n  salt.  The old version of crypt() used the provided bad salt (always \"!\")\n  to produce a DES hash with \"!!\" at the beginning, while the new one just\n  returns NULL which isn't well-handled by the shadow code.  To fix this\n  shadow bug, if the salt is invalid, we'll call crypt() using a good SHA512\n  salt, prepend \"!!\" to the hash that we get back, and have pw_encrypt()\n  return this as the result.  The effect is identical to the previous\n  behavior -- unless the exact same malformed hash happens to be the hash in\n  /etc/shadow (it won't be), the login will fail.  While I see no way that\n  these 6 lines of code could be less secure than the original code, I\n  welcome additional review.  Also, if anyone spots anything else that was\n  adversely affected by the change to crypt()'s behavior, please let me know.\n  Thanks to Michael L. Semon for informing me of the /bin/login problem.\n",

Thanks are\ndue to Heinz Wiesinger for his work on transitioning the build script,\ntesting, and getting us all behind this move.  He's been working with\nMariaDB (and their developers) for several years now.  Vincent Batts also\nhad a hand in the early discussions here -- he met Daniel Bartholomew of\nMariaDB on a train last year and got a copy of the source to play with to\npass the time on the journey (ah, the miracle of thumbdrives :), and was\nimpressed with not only MariaDB itself, but also with the welcome that\nSlackware was getting.  We expect they'll be responsive to any concerns\nwe have.  In the vast majority of situations, MariaDB is entirely\ncompatible with existing MySQL databases and will drop right in with no\nchanges required.  There's an article available outlining the areas in\nwhich MariaDB differs from MySQL that I'd recommend reading:\n  https://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb-versus-mysql-compatibility/\nThanks to the MariaDB Foundation!  We look forward to working with you.\n",

Seems it works either way, but since\n  GPT is not required that allows us to add the support for UEFI boot to the\n  regular USB installer image.  Unfortunately, this image still does not\n  work any better (or differently) as an El-Torito boot image for EFI on\n  an ISO.  In tests here, elilo loads but runs into an error while loading\n  the initrd.  I've experimented with different -boot-load-size options\n  (including way too large to be sure the whole image is mapped) but so\n  far it has not worked.  If anyone figures out the trick to making this work,\n  let me know.  It would be nice to have the DVD bootable under UEFI, and it\n  wouldn't take any extra space since the usbboot.img file will be on the\n  disc anyway.\n",

            "description": "Here we go with some more updates...  a few notes on them are in order.\nFor this kernel update I decided to go with 3.7.10.  Yeah, the 3.7 series\nis EOL, but I've heard about some broken drivers in 3.8.x that make me\nhesitate to push forward.  Another option might be to move to 3.4.x, which\nis working on my machine finally (a clocksource bug was crashing it with\nearlier versions).  The USB host and usb-storage drivers are now modular\nin both the huge and generic kernels to avoid an issue where a USB stick\ncould be assigned /dev/sda when running the huge kernel.  The brcmsmac\ndriver for Broadcom wifi is built.  However, this takes over for any\nBroadcom card that it can support -- those cards will no longer be supported\nby the b43 driver.  So, if you're currently using b43 and find that it no\nlonger works, you'll need to move to the brcmsmac driver instead.  It's\ntechnically possible to build these with the overlapping support, but it's\na mess that way which is probably why nobody else is doing that.  And finally,\nrudimentary UEFI support makes its first appearance in -current in the form\nof a bootable USB image called efiboot.img.  Still no support in the\ninstaller for setting up elilo, but this will at least get Linux installed\nwithout the need for Legacy BIOS support.  Looking into how to set up the\nboot support in the installer will be the next order of business, and I\nhave a few different ideas about the way to go about that...  probably\nsome good material for a discussion on LQ.  BTW, a GPT FAT image like this\none is _supposed_ to work as an El-Torito alternate boot image when creating\nan ISO image (extra mkisofs options: -eltorito-alt-boot -no-emul-boot\n-eltorito-platform 0xEF -eltorito-boot usb-and-pxe-installers/efiboot.img),\nbut it's mostly not working here.  I did get one of these to work when booted\nfrom an ISO, but all the attempts after that failed.  Looks like it might be\na problem with the -boot-load-size being detected properly for one magic\nEFI image and not for all the others.  If anyone is brave or bored enough to\nlook into that, hints are gratefully accepted.  Anyway, that's it for now.\nHave fun!\n",

Please consider supporting the Slackware\nproject by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking\npre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.\n\nThanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the\nupstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.\n\nHave fun!  :-)\n",
