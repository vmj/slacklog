If the\n  luck o' the Irish is with us, it'll be a fairly short alpha/beta/rc\n  period from here.  Well, have fun!\n  A couple notes:\n  1. The only kernels provided (for now) support SMP.  I've seen the\n     installer go nuts on a few machines with multiple cores where a\n     uniprocessor core worked fine.  More kernel choices will very\n     likely be added.\n  2. Floppy booting (other than via PXE) is likely gone for good, but\n     between PXE and USB flash memory boot, (along with the standard\n     ISO boot), most machines should be covered.\n  3. This is still a work in progress, so don't be too hard on us.  ;-)\na/kernel-generic-2.6.18.8_smp-i486-1.tgz:\n  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP generic.s (requires initrd) kernel.\na/kernel-huge-2.6.18.8_smp-i486-1.tgz:\n  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP huge.s (full-featured) kernel.\na/kernel-modules-2.6.18.8_smp-i486-1.tgz\n  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP kernel modules.\n",

It\nlooks as if Slackware -current (future 12.0?) is going to charge into 2.6-only\nterritory, but it will be a conservative \"charge\".  :-)  The overwhelming\nconsensus is that the 2.6 series is now more than stable enough for production\nuse.  Some folks expressed concern over the loss of Linux 2.4.x compatibility,\nbut they were a definite minority.  Some suggested maintaining two -current\nbranches -- one following 2.4 and the other 2.6.  The solution that'll be\ntaken concerning 2.4.x will be to make Slackware 11.0 better maintained than\nsimply security updates.  It should see some other non-security updates as\nwell (perhaps the introduction of an /updates directory?), and will be a long\nlived OS for those who swear by the stability of the 2.4.x kernel series.\nMeanwhile, 2.4.x compatibility features (such as the, er, mess? going on in\nthe startup scripts) will be steadily eliminated in -current to focus on the\nbest possible 2.6.x support.  With a lot of work, we should be able to make\nthe next Slackware release an excellent choice for both servers and desktops.\nAgain -- thanks for all the input!  :-)\n",

Personally,\n    I'd rather not as 2.4 is more forgiving of flaky hardware and thus\n    tends to get better uptimes (at least on the servers I run ;-).\n    Comments about this issue are welcomed.\n    glibc-2.5 has also been having some problems with locale support here\n    that need to be investigated and dealt with.  I'd rather base the glibc\n    in Slackware on an official glibc release, but using the development\n    repo is also something under (slight) consideration if it works better.\n",
