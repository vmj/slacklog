  Sanitize the diagnostic output of the original file name in verbose mode.
  By using a made up file name in the message it was possible to fake status
  messages. Using this technique it was for example possible to fake the
  verification status of a signed mail.

patches/packages/git-2.14.4-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo
  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../" into the
  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause
  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).
  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.
  It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS
  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).
  Credit for fixing for these bugs goes to Jeff King, Johannes
  Schindelin and others.

patches/packages/libXcursor-1.1.15-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot
  the system).

  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P5-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

patches/packages/libpng-1.2.57-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P4-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

patches/packages/wget-1.18-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions
  of wget.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would
  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the
  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works
  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original
  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the
  user must provide --trust-server-names.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by
  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.

patches/packages/curl-7.47.1-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where NTLM credentials are not checked
  for proxy connection reuse.  The effects of this flaw is that the application
  could be reusing a proxy connection using the previously used credentials
  and thus it could be given to or prevented access from resources that it
  wasn't intended to.  Thanks to Isaac Boukris.

  This update fixes an information leak and a buffer overflow.  In particular,
  the information leak allows a malicious SSH server to steal the client's
  private keys.  Thanks to Qualys for reporting this issue.

  *****************************************************************
  * IMPORTANT:  READ BELOW ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES *
  *****************************************************************
  Rather than backport the fix for the information leak (which is the only
  hazardous flaw), we have upgraded to the latest OpenSSH.  As of version
  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)
  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,
  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and
  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system
  after the upgrade.
  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes
  to be aware of:
  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
    default at compile time.
  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
    changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
    were enabled).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P3-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes two denial-of-service vulnerabilities:
  + CVE-2015-5722 is a denial-of-service vector which can be
  exploited remotely against a BIND server that is performing
  validation on DNSSEC-signed records.  Validating recursive
  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not
  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an
  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers
  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,
  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to
  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.
  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.
  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used
  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation
  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk
  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could
  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under
  limited conditions.
  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to
  CVE-2015-5986.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P2-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an error in the handling of TKEY
  queries can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service
  vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE
  assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.
  Impact:
  Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this defect.
  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration
  options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs
  early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.
  Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as soon as
  possible.

Tue Jul  7 22:59:17 UTC 2015
patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P1-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an attacker who can cause
  a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed
  contents can cause that resolver to fail an assertion and terminate due
  to a defect in validation code.  This means that a recursive resolver that
  is performing DNSSEC validation can be deliberately stopped by an attacker
  who can cause the resolver to perform a query against a
  maliciously-constructed zone.  This will result in a denial of service to
  clients who rely on that resolver.

patches/packages/ntp-4.2.8p3-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where under specific circumstances an
  attacker can send a crafted packet to cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to
  crash.  Since this requires 1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration
  (not allowed by default), and 2) knowledge of the configuration password,
  and 3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration,
  the vulnerability is considered low-risk.

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssl-0.9.8zc-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  SRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513):
    A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
    sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
    to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):
    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
    attack.
  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:
    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
    downgrade.
    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):
    When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.

patches/packages/bash-3.1.020-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Another bash update.  Here's some information included with the patch:
    "This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid
    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment
    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell
    function."
  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser
  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%
  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,
  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break
  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as
  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another
  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,
  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/ntp-4.2.6p5-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  All stable versions of NTP remain vulnerable to a remote attack where the
  "ntpdc -c monlist" command can be used to amplify network traffic as part
  of a denial of service attack.  By default, Slackware is not vulnerable
  since it includes "noquery" as a default restriction.  However, it is
  vulnerable if this restriction is removed.  To help mitigate this flaw,
  "disable monitor" has been added to the default ntp.conf (which will disable
  the monlist command even if other queries are allowed), and the default
  restrictions have been extended to IPv6 as well.
  All users of the NTP daemon should make sure that their ntp.conf contains
  "disable monitor" to prevent misuse of the NTP service.  The new ntp.conf
  file will be installed as /etc/ntp.conf.new with a package upgrade, but the
  changes will need to be merged into any existing ntp.conf file by the admin.

  All branches of libpng prior to versions 1.5.9, 1.4.9, 1.2.47, and 1.0.57,
  respectively, fail to correctly validate a heap allocation in

  supported by php.net any longer, so there wasn't a lot of choice
  in the matter.  We're not able to support a security fork of
  PHP 5.2.x here either, so you'll have to just bite the bullet on

patches/packages/proftpd-1.3.3d-x86_64-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an unbounded copy operation in sql_prepare_where() that
  could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  However, this only affects
  servers that use the sql_mod module (which Slackware does not ship), and
  in addition the ability to exploit this depends on an SQL injection bug
  that was already fixed in proftpd-1.3.2rc2 (this according to upstream).
  So in theory, this fix should only be of academic interest.
  But in practice, better safe than sorry.

  With Thunderbird 2.x unmaintained, it seems like a good idea to provide a
  upgrade to Thunderbird 3.x for security reasons.  This will bring with it
  quite a bit of changed functionality, so be prepared...  one hint is that
  it will now make local copies of remote mailboxes by default, so you will
  need to have enough disk space to handle that.

  As of version 2.0, SeaMonkey no longer includes a shared libgtkmozembed
  library, so the pkgconfig and header files for this have been removed from
  the package to avoid confusion over why trying to compile programs that
  use it no longer works.  There's not really any way to avoid this issue --
  it's either upgrade SeaMonkey and lose libgtkmozembed, or keep using version
  1.1.18 and miss out on SeaMonkey security updates.  If you really need
  libgtkmozembed, the seamonkey-1.1.18 packages will be retained in either
  /patches or /pasture for Slackware versions 13.0 and earlier.

patches/packages/mesa-7.5-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed install script to add glxinfo and other programs that were part
  of previous Mesa patches.  I was under the impression that these no longer
  built, and had been deprecated upstream.  Thanks to Adam Kirchhoff for

    match the original gameplay (DEC microVAX, early 1990s).
    Don't use unsigned (fix unsigned comparison warning).
    Bump patchlevel.
  Thanks to Gary Carvell.
Added 2.6.30.5 generic Linux kernel packages in /testing.  Release time
is getting close, so we're sticking with the 2.6.29.6 kernels as the main
kernels for Slackware 13.0.  Besides, we know of at least one tricky issue
with 2.6.30.x and the LILO bootloader, and the workaround that we know of
likely isn't going to work on BIOSes older than 2001.  Be sure to read the
README_FIRST.TXT (really!) in the directory with the kernel packages if you
intend to try these.

  This update fixes a bug in Pidgin's MSN protocol implementation can allow
  a remote attacker to send a malicious MSN message to a Pidgin user, which
  will possibly cause arbitrary code to be executed as that user.
  This issue was discovered by Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies.
  For more information, see:

    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2694
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 18 18:50:46 CDT 2009
  Patched kernels and kernel packages for Linux 2.6.29.6 to address
  a bug in proto_ops structures which could allow a user to use the
  kernel sendpage operation to execute arbitrary code in page zero.
  This could allow local users to gain escalated privileges.
  This flaw was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the
  Google Security Team.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2692
  In addition, these kernels change the CONFIG_SECURITY_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
  kernel config option value to 4096, which should prevent the execution
  of arbitrary code by future NULL dereference bugs that might be found
  in the kernel.  If you are compiling your own kernel, please check this
  option in your .config.  If it is set to =0, you may wish to edit it
  to 4096 (or some other value > 0) and then reconfigure, or the kernel
  will not have default protection against zero page attacks from
  userspace.

  hang consuming 100% CPU.  We couldn't find a fix, and honestly RC2 just
  wasn't a good time to upgrade xfig (3.2.4 also required many patches to

Hi folks!  We're going to call this set of updates RC2.  There are still
README files to be handled (that's the nature of documentation, I guess), as
well as some other things remaining on the TODO list, but X seems pretty
stable now, and it seems like a release soon would be in order so that we
can march right back into development territory with -current again soon.  :-)
Enjoy, and let us know about any problems you run into!

  KDE 4.2.4 was developed on for now.

Hi folks -- the TODO isn't entirely empty here, but it's pretty much down
to minor nits, and so we're going to call this release candidate #1 and
(mostly) freeze further updates unless they happen to fix problems.
Regarding the kernel, 2.6.29.x has been well tested with this userspace
and seems like the best choice to ship for production use.  Perhaps we
can put something else (at least source and configs) in /testing, though.
a/slocate-3.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.  Don't index cifs or tmpfs.
  Add a few more directories to the list of paths to prune.

x/mesa-7.4.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, actually more like "switched", or "reverted".  After many hours
  trying to track down the reason for reported instability with X and
  compositing (such as crashes when adjusting advanced desktop settings in
  KDE), we've found that it seems to happen only with MesaLib 7.4.2.  Rather
  than trying to cherry-pick changes between 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, we've switched
  to shipping 7.4.1 in the main tree, and have not run into any such problems
  since making the switch.  If people want to continue testing 7.4.2, we've
  moved it into /testing.  Let us know if you run into any problems with
  7.4.1 that are fixed with 7.4.2, and we'll take a look at individual diffs.
extra/kde3-compat/arts-1.5.10-x86_64-opt1.txz:  Added.
extra/kde3-compat/k3b3-1.0.5-x86_64-opt1.txz:  Added.
  In case the KDE4 version of k3b is not stable, this KDE3 version may be
  used along with the KDE3 compatibility packages in extra/kde3-compat/.
extra/kde3-compat/kdelibs3-3.5.10-x86_64-opt1.txz:  Added.

  regressions.

Thu Jun 18 21:21:04 CDT 2009
The last kernel updates had the wrong names in the ChangeLog due to a cut
and paste error from the IA32 ChangeLog, but it was actually a good thing
because we realized some of the slack-desc files were incorrect as well.

This batch of updates includes a major overhaul of X.Org -- thanks to Robby
Workman for doing a huge amount of work updating the build scripts and testing
everything.  A large number of packages were recompiled or upgraded to drop
references to the now-obsolete libxcb-xlib and libXaw8 libraries.  We have
workarounds in place for old binaries so it wasn't strictly required, but
recompiling anyway gives a cleaner system.  Enjoy!

ap/hplip-3.9.4b-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.  Changed the ./configure options to
  restore foomatic-rip-hplip, as some printers still don't work using the
  regular foomatic-rip filter.  This might require your PPDs to be regenerated
  by removing the printer and reinstalling it.  Thanks to Robby Workman.

<tick> <tick> Ermm... is this thing on?

Initial public release of Slackware64-current.
He's trying to lay low, but thanks to Eric Hameleers for the huge amount
of work he did to make this possible.  :-)

Enjoy!
