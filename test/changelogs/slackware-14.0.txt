  Submodules' "URL"s come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly gave it to "git clone" to clone submodules when "git clone
  --recurse-submodules" was used to clone a project that has such a
  submodule. The code has been hardened to reject such malformed URLs
  (e.g. one that begins with a dash). Credit for finding and fixing this
  vulnerability goes to joernchen and Jeff King, respectively.

patches/packages/ntp-4.2.8p12-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release improves on one security fix in ntpd:
    LOW/MEDIUM: Sec 3012: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack
    While fixed in ntp-4.2.8p7 and with significant additional protections for
    this issue in 4.2.8p11, ntp-4.2.8p12 includes a fix for an edge case in
    the new noepeer support. Originally reported by Matt Van Gundy of Cisco.
    Edge-case hole reported by Martin Burnicki of Meinberg.
  And fixes another security issue in ntpq and ntpdc:
    LOW: Sec 3505: The openhost() function used during command-line hostname
    processing by ntpq and ntpdc can write beyond its buffer limit, which
    could allow  an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher
    privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6
    command-line parameter. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common
    situations in which ntpq or ntpdc is used with a command line from an
    untrusted source. Reported by Fakhri Zulkifli.

patches/packages/git-2.14.4-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo
  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../" into the
  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause
  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).
  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.
  It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS
  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).
  Credit for fixing for these bugs goes to Jeff King, Johannes
  Schindelin and others.

patches/packages/libXcursor-1.1.15-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot

patches/packages/samba-4.4.16-i486-2_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This is a security update in order to patch the following defects:
  CVE-2017-14746 (Use-after-free vulnerability.)
    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a use after
    free vulnerability, where a malicious SMB1 request can be used to
    control the contents of heap memory via a deallocated heap pointer. It
    is possible this may be used to compromise the SMB server.
  CVE-2017-15275 (Server heap memory information leak.)
    All versions of Samba from 3.6.0 onwards are vulnerable to a heap
    memory information leak, where server allocated heap memory may be
    returned to the client without being cleared.

  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  SMB1/2/3 connections may not require signing where they should. A man in the
  middle attack may hijack client connections.
  SMB3 connections don't keep encryption across DFS redirects. A man in the
  middle attack can read and may alter confidential documents transferred via
  a client connection, which are reached via DFS redirect when the original
  connection used SMB3.
  Server memory information leak over SMB1. Client with write access to a share
  can cause server memory contents to be written into a file or printer.

patches/packages/bash-4.2.053-i486-2_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update fixes two security issues found in bash before 4.4:
  The expansion of '\h' in the prompt string allows remote authenticated users
  to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters placed in 'hostname' of a
  machine. The theoretical attack vector is a hostile DHCP server providing a
  crafted hostname, but this is unlikely to occur in a normal Slackware
  configuration as we ignore the hostname provided by DHCP.
  Specially crafted SHELLOPTS+PS4 environment variables used against bogus
  setuid binaries using system()/popen() allowed local attackers to execute
  arbitrary code as root.

patches/packages/xorg-server-1.12.4-i486-3_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update fixes two security issues:
  A user authenticated to an X Session could crash or execute code in the
  context of the X Server by exploiting a stack overflow in the endianness
  conversion of X Events.
  Uninitialized data in endianness conversion in the XEvent handling of the
  X.Org X Server allowed authenticated malicious users to access potentially
  privileged data from the X server.

patches/packages/git-2.14.1-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

  Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and could
  be abused to write to files outside the repository.
  Mercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing
  shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname starting
  with -oProxyCommand.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P5-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

patches/packages/libpng-1.4.20-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

  This kernel fixes a security issue known as "Dirty COW".  A race
  condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem
  handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only
  memory mappings.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to
  gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus
  increase their privileges on the system.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd and reinstall LILO after upgrading
  the kernel packages.

patches/packages/wget-1.18-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions
  of wget.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would
  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the
  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works
  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original
  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the
  user must provide --trust-server-names.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by
  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.

  Fixed weak key generation.  Due to a bug in the ephemeral secret key
  generation for the diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14
  methods, ephemeral secret keys of size 128 bits are generated, instead
  of the recommended sizes of 1024 and 2048 bits, giving a practical

  This update fixes a security issue where NTLM credentials are not checked
  for proxy connection reuse.  The effects of this flaw is that the application
  could be reusing a proxy connection using the previously used credentials
  and thus it could be given to or prevented access from resources that it
  wasn't intended to.  Thanks to Isaac Boukris.

  PHP 5.4.x has been declared EOL (end of life) and is no longer receiving
  upstream support.  PHP 5.5.x is also no longer on active support status and
  security fixes will continue only until 5 months from now.  For this reason
  we have provided PHP 5.6 packages as security updates.  Be aware that PHP
  5.6 is not 100% compatible with PHP 5.4, and some changes may be required
  to existing web pages written for PHP 5.4.
  For information on how to migrate from PHP 5.4, please see:

patches/packages/openssh-7.1p2-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an information leak and a buffer overflow.  In particular,
  the information leak allows a malicious SSH server to steal the client's
  private keys.  Thanks to Qualys for reporting this issue.
  For more information, see:
    https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt

  *****************************************************************
  * IMPORTANT:  READ BELOW ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES *
  *****************************************************************
  Rather than backport the fix for the information leak (which is the only
  hazardous flaw), we have upgraded to the latest OpenSSH.  As of version
  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)
  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,
  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and
  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system
  after the upgrade.
  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes
  to be aware of:
  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
    default at compile time.
  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
    changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
    were enabled).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P3-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes two denial-of-service vulnerabilities:
  + CVE-2015-5722 is a denial-of-service vector which can be
  exploited remotely against a BIND server that is performing
  validation on DNSSEC-signed records.  Validating recursive
  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not
  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an
  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers
  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,
  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to
  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.
  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.
  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used
  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation
  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk
  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could
  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under
  limited conditions.
  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to
  CVE-2015-5986.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P2-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an error in the handling of TKEY
  queries can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service
  vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE
  assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.
  Impact:
  Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this defect.
  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration
  options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs
  early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.
  Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as soon as
  possible.

patches/packages/openssl-1.0.1p-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes the following security issue:
  Alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793).
  During certificate verification, OpenSSL (starting from version 1.0.1n and
  1.0.2b) will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first
  attempt to build such a chain fails.  An error in the implementation of this
  logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted
  certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a
  valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.
  This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including
  SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.
  This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o.
  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 24th June 2015 by Adam Langley/David
  Benjamin (Google/BoringSSL).  The fix was developed by the BoringSSL project.
  For more information, see:

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P1-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an attacker who can cause
  a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed
  contents can cause that resolver to fail an assertion and terminate due
  to a defect in validation code.  This means that a recursive resolver that
  is performing DNSSEC validation can be deliberately stopped by an attacker
  who can cause the resolver to perform a query against a
  maliciously-constructed zone.  This will result in a denial of service to
  clients who rely on that resolver.

    This bug could allow an attacker to upload a replacement CUPS
    configuration file and mount further attacks.

patches/packages/ntp-4.2.8p3-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where under specific circumstances an
  attacker can send a crafted packet to cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to
  crash.  Since this requires 1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration
  (not allowed by default), and 2) knowledge of the configuration password,
  and 3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration,
  the vulnerability is considered low-risk.

patches/packages/openssl-1.0.1j-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  SRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513):
    A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
    sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
    to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):
    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
    attack.
  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:
    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
    downgrade.
    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):
    When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.

patches/packages/bash-4.2.050-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Another bash update.  Here's some information included with the patch:
    "This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid
    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment
    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell
    function."
  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser
  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%
  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,
  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break
  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as
  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another
  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,
  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).
  Thanks to Florian Weimer and Chet Ramey.

  This update fixes two security issues:
  CVE-2013-4496:
  Samba versions 3.4.0 and above allow the administrator to implement
  locking out Samba accounts after a number of bad password attempts.
  However, all released versions of Samba did not implement this check for
  password changes, such as are available over multiple SAMR and RAP
  interfaces, allowing password guessing attacks.
  CVE-2013-6442:
  Samba versions 4.0.0 and above have a flaw in the smbcacls command. If
  smbcacls is used with the "-C|--chown name" or "-G|--chgrp name"
  command options it will remove the existing ACL on the object being

patches/packages/ntp-4.2.6p5-i486-3_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.
  All stable versions of NTP remain vulnerable to a remote attack where the
  "ntpdc -c monlist" command can be used to amplify network traffic as part
  of a denial of service attack.  By default, Slackware is not vulnerable
  since it includes "noquery" as a default restriction.  However, it is
  vulnerable if this restriction is removed.  To help mitigate this flaw,
  "disable monitor" has been added to the default ntp.conf (which will disable
  the monlist command even if other queries are allowed), and the default
  restrictions have been extended to IPv6 as well.
  All users of the NTP daemon should make sure that their ntp.conf contains
  "disable monitor" to prevent misuse of the NTP service.  The new ntp.conf
  file will be installed as /etc/ntp.conf.new with a package upgrade, but the
  changes will need to be merged into any existing ntp.conf file by the admin.

  The asn1_time_to_time_t function in ext/openssl/openssl.c in PHP before
  5.3.28, 5.4.x before 5.4.23, and 5.5.x before 5.5.7 does not properly
  parse (1) notBefore and (2) notAfter timestamps in X.509 certificates,
  which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
  of service (memory corruption) via a crafted certificate that is not
  properly handled by the openssl_x509_parse function.

patches/packages/libiodbc-3.52.8-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an rpath pointing to a location in /tmp that was found in
  two test programs (iodbctest and iodbctestw).  This could have allowed a
  local attacker with write access to /tmp to add modified libraries (and
  execute arbitrary code) as any user running the test programs.
  Thanks to Christopher Oliver for the bug report.

  Fix use of uninitialized memory when decoding images with missing SOS data
  for the luminance component (Y) in presence of valid chroma data (Cr, Cb).
  This could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from
  uninitialized memory locations via a crafted JPEG image.

  add modified libraries (and execute arbitrary code) as any user running
  the LLVM binaries.  This updated package rebuilds LLVM to exclude the

patches/packages/curl-7.29.0-i486-3_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.

  This is a bugfix release.  It also fixes a security issue -- a heap-based
  overflow in the quoted_printable_encode() function, which could be used by
  a remote attacker to crash PHP or execute code as the 'apache' user.

patches/packages/linux-3.2.45/*:  Rebuilt.
  One more reverted commit.  This one was leading to hangs on systems with
  Intel graphics.  The previous revert was also reverted in 3.2.46, but it
  seems safer to just get this one manually than to take the newer kernel and
  still have to do another patch to it anyway.  Hopefully the third time is
  the charm.  :)
+--------------------------+

patches/packages/linux-3.2.45/*:  Rebuilt.
  It appears a bad commit slipped into 3.2.45 and it's causing problems on
  systems that use Intel graphics.  The commit has been reverted in the kernel
  source packages and the kernels and modules have been rebuilt.  If you ran
  into the black screen problem before, this should fix it up.

patches/packages/curl-7.29.0-i486-1_slack14.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.  This vulnerability
  can be exploited by someone who is in control of a server that a libcurl
  based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or IMAP.  For applications
  that accept user provided URLs, it is also thinkable that a malicious
  user would feed an application with a URL to a server hosting code
  targeting this flaw.
  Affected versions: curl 7.26.0 to and including 7.28.1

patches/packages/libxml2-2.8.0-i486-2_slack14.0.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched a heap-based buffer underflow in the xmlParseAttValueComplex
  function in parser.c in libxml2 2.9.0 and earlier that could allow a
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
  arbitrary code via crafted entities in an XML document.

Slackware 14.0 x86 stable is released!

We're perfectionists here at Slackware, so this release has been a long
time a-brewing.  But we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait.
Slackware 14.0 combines modern components, ease of use, and flexible
configuration... our "KISS" philosophy demands it.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the
upstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.

Have fun!  :-)

a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-13.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Changed the path in rc.M for wicd from relative to absolute.  It works
  either way, but it should be an absolute path just to be consistent with
  the rest of the script.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 24 20:25:12 UTC 2012
Here are a few minor bugfixes as well as a couple more test drivers for X:
a/e2fsprogs-1.42.6-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-12.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.M, don't run rc.wicd if /usr/sbin/wicd does not exist.  This change
  prevents a leftover rc.wicd from blocking NetworkManager startup.
l/gamin-0.1.10-i486-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix a deadlock bug, and to fix building against recent libraries.
  Thanks to sberthelot, sombragris, and ponce on LQ.
l/mozilla-nss-3.13.5-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added libcrmf.a to the package, needed to compile xulrunner.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.42.6.
testing/packages/xf86-video-ati-6.14.6-i486-1.txz:  Added.
  This driver requires the libdrm in /testing.
testing/packages/xf86-video-intel-2.20.8-i486-1.txz:  Added.
  This driver requires the libdrm in /testing.
testing/source/config-testing-3.*:  Rebuilt.
  Changed CONFIG_GFS2_FS in huge kernels from y -> m to fix the compile.
usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.42.6.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep 22 00:34:26 UTC 2012
I'll go along with the last minute request to provide the released stable
version of xf86-video-nouveau.  The reason that we hadn't done this is that
the stable version of Mesa won't compile with this version of libdrm.  But,
since xf86-video-nouveau compiles fine with this libdrm and the Mesa we're
already shipping, it seems reasonable to provide them here in /testing.
Thanks to Didier Spaier.
testing/packages/libdrm-2.4.39-i486-1.txz:  Added.
testing/packages/xf86-video-nouveau-1.0.2-i486-1.txz:  Added.

Here we go one more time with Slackware 14.0 release candidate 5.
Really, this time it is not a drill!  Everything is in place and
ready to release at this point, and unless there's some kind of
showstopper found (which doesn't seem too likely after all the
testing that's happened), the release can be expected soon.
After careful consideration and a considerable amount of internal
testing I did relent to give the kernel one more bump to 3.2.29,
so of course 3.2.30 was released a couple of hours ago.  ;-)
But that's not a showstopper, and it seems to be time to get off
the never-ending kernel upgrade treadmill until the next cycle
begins.  Speaking of kernels, I added sample .configs for all the
3.x kernel branches in /testing.  So test away, and if there are
any new problems (or old ones that we missed), let us know soon!
a/glibc-solibs-2.15-i486-7.txz:  Rebuilt.

n/dhcp-4.2.4_P2-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  An issue with the use of lease times was found and fixed.  Making certain
  changes to the end time of an IPv6 lease could cause the server to abort.
  Thanks to Glen Eustace of Massey University, New Zealand for finding this
  issue.  [ISC-Bugs #30281]

a/patch-2.7-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version of patch ignores destination filenames that are absolute or
  that contain a component of "..", unless such a filename is provided as
  an argument.

  might still be required by third party scanner drivers.
  Thanks to Alex Baer.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-11.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Edited rc.S to talk about the 3.x kernel in the udev comments.
  Edited rc.M to run rc.udev in all cases again, not just when returning
  from runlevel 1.  Even if udev is running already, the additional
  trigger may be required in order to get some devices working.  The
  comment that indicated it should only be run when returning from
  runlevel 1 came from a time when the only purpose for rc.udev was to
  start it if it wasn't running.  The behavior has changed since then, so
  the comment has been fixed.  Guess I should have remembered the words of:
    fortune -m Storer
l/libsoup-2.38.1-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added the .la files back, as it's not yet safe to eliminate them in this
  package.  Thanks to Erik Hanson.
n/bind-9.9.1_P3-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where named could crash on a specially
  crafted record.  [RT #30416]

n/netatalk-2.2.3-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.

  upgraded instead of deleting it and leaving nothing but the old rc.atalk.
  Thanks to Sorin Mitrica.
+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 12 02:45:31 UTC 2012
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-10.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Use start parameter when running /etc/rc.d/rc.atalk.
n/ca-certificates-20120623-noarch-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Use an installer script to make sure that update-ca-certificates works on
  a fresh installation.  Thanks to DarkVision on LQ.
n/netatalk-2.2.3-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Switched to a better rc.atalk that parses the contents of netatalk.conf.
  Thanks to gerasimos_h.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 10 22:19:55 UTC 2012
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-9.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.M, make sure we are actually returning from runlevel 1 before trying
  to restart udev.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
a/udev-182-i486-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't enable autosuspend for some HID devices.  With a 3.5+ kernel, this
  might cause these input devices to become non-responsive.
  Thanks to Patrick Verner.

  This is a bugfix release.
xap/xine-ui-0.99.6-i686-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Willy Sudiarto Raharjo claims this one is better than 0.99.5, so I guess we
  will see (quickly).  After this, I'm going to be far more resistant to any
  attempts to try to resume the devel cycle.  ;-)
+--------------------------+
Sun Sep  9 03:00:36 UTC 2012
xap/xine-ui-0.99.5-i686-3.txz:  Reverted.
  The file open shortcut appears to be broken in the newer xine-ui.  Probably
  safer to just revert it at this point.  The new xine-lib seems OK, though.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep  8 20:04:10 UTC 2012
ap/mc-4.8.4-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  The stable verson of mc has several known, annoying bugs.  They are fixed in
  this version...  hopefully without too many new ones.
xap/xine-lib-1.1.21-i686-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release, and had flown under the radar here due to previous
  1.2.x releases.  I've tested it and it at least works as well as the package
  it replaces.  With phonon-xine deprecated, I'm not sure how long Xine will
  be included in Slackware, but this update doesn't seem to hurt so we'll take
  it.  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.
xap/xine-ui-0.99.7-i686-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep  7 20:27:46 UTC 2012
a/dcron-4.5-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  After following the discussion about it on LQ, it seems better to not
  direct script output in run-parts to /dev/null, since the default crontab
  does that already.  That way if someone wants to get cron job output
  mailed to them it's easy to do by editing the crontab.  Thanks to NoStressHQ.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-8.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Updated rescan-scsi-bus and patched around a test that fails.
  Thanks to slacktroll on LQ.
xap/mozilla-firefox-15.0.1-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.

Thu Sep  6 21:58:57 UTC 2012
a/dcron-4.5-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed run-parts to only output stderr, so that cron will only send mail
  in the event that a script runs into errors.
  Thanks to Barcoboy on LQ.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.S, don't run cryptsetup three times in a loop, since it will already
  allow three password attempts by default.
  Thanks to Michael L. Semon.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep  4 21:54:46 UTC 2012

e/emacs-24.2-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 30 23:35:53 UTC 2012
Well, we fixed a lot of bugs and took some upgrades that we pretty much
needed to take since they were important bug and/or security fixes, so
it looks like we'll need to have a 14.0 release candidate 4 and another
(last?) round of testing.  Hopefully the fourth time is the charm!
a/cpio-2.11-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fix CRC evaluation.
  Thanks to appzer0 and Nekrodes.
a/dbus-1.4.20-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to set HOME properly to avoid a /.config directory.  The fix is
  a little ugly, but seems harmless enough (and is less ugly than /.config).

  Patched multiple integer overflows in the strtod, strtof, strtold, and
  strtod_l functions in stdlib in the GNU C Library allow local users to
  cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
  arbitrary code via a long string, which triggers a stack-based buffer
  overflow.

This is Slackware 14.0 release candidate 3, and is hopefully the last stop
on our long road to a stable Slackware release soon.  After hearing that
the 3.4.x kernel series will have long term support, I tested 3.4.9 hoping
that it would prove stable enough to use that as the release kernel, but
there are problems with an oops in kernel/time/clocksource.c every few boots.
Given that the 3.2.x series has been very stable, it seems prudent to stick
with that for release, and 3.2.28 is going to be the release kernel.  So,
one more round of testing.  Let me know if there are any problems.  Thanks!

e/emacs-24.1-i486-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix a security flaw in the file-local variables code.
  When the Emacs user option `enable-local-variables' is set to `:safe'
  (the default value is t), Emacs should automatically refuse to evaluate
  `eval' forms in file-local variable sections.  Due to the bug, Emacs
  instead automatically evaluates such `eval' forms.  Thus, if the user
  changes the value of `enable-local-variables' to `:safe', visiting a
  malicious file can cause automatic execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp
  code with the permissions of the user.  Bug discovered by Paul Ling.

  Switched to a new rc.yp script supporting start|stop|restart.
  If there's an existing script, it will be installed as a .new with the same
  permissions as the existing rc.yp, which had defaulted to executable since
  without editing it did nothing.  Unless you plan to use YP, be aware that
  moving the new script into place with 755 perms will cause a line of

Good hello, and happy Thursday!  Mercury went direct early yesterday morning,
and it was like the bugs started to fix themselves.  It's almost enough to get
me believing in that hocus-pocus nonsense!  So, here's a bunch of updates that
fix all of the reported issues in the beta, and we'll call this the 14.0
release candidate 1.  Still some updates needed for the top-level
documentation files, but we're clearly in the home stretch now (finally).

  Linked against icu4c.  The built script was also upgraded to account for

  Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger.
l/glib2-2.32.4-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/gnome-keyring-3.4.1-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.

    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3466
  (* Security fix *)
l/gtk+3-3.4.4-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/polkit-0.105-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added default policy files for udisks2 and NetworkManager events.  These
  along with GazL's xinitrc/startup script improvements seem to prevent
  ConsoleKit, PolicyKit, and D-Bus from being stupid most of the time.
  GazL's fix _should_ have been enough, but you know what they say about
  the difference between theory and practice.  :-)  The NetworkManager .pkla
  file seems to be needed anyway to allow users in the netdev group to
  modify network settings without being bothered to enter the root password.
  Thanks much to Chess Griffin.
l/qt-4.8.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched libQtWebKit.la and QtWebKit.pc to remove a false dependency on
  libwebcore.a, which is used internally at build time.

n/openssl-1.0.1c-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched the certwatch script to quit warning about expired certificates
  in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.  The script was intended to warn
  when your personal certificates are about to expire, but it trips over
  this one that bundles the CA certs.  Thanks to ponce.
n/php-5.4.5-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added support for intl module.
  Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger.
n/wireless-tools-29-i486-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't use the directory /sys/class/netdev_name/wireless/ directory to
  detect wireless cards in rc.wireless as it depends on
  CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT_SYSFS=y in the kernel, which is deprecated and will
  be removed in future kernels.  Perhaps this was the cause of some of the
  reports of non-functional wireless interfaces?
  Thanks to Konrad Rzepecki.
x/x11-skel-7.7-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  In xwmconfig, write a $HOME/.xsession in addition to $HOME/.xinitrc,
  allowing users to choose a default window manager when using XDM.
  Thanks to GazL.
x/xterm-281-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
xap/blackbox-0.70.1-i486-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Created a new startup script "startblackbox" called from xinitrc.blackbox
  to allow running dbus-launch within ck-session-launch.  This fixes Thunar
  device mounting without breaking XDM.  Thanks much to GazL!
xap/fluxbox-1.3.2-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch in startfluxbox.  Thanks to GazL.
xap/fvwm-2.6.5-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Created a new startup script "startfvwm2" called from xinitrc.fvwm2 to allow
  running dbus-launch within ck-session-launch.  Thanks to GazL.

a/gdisk-0.6.14-i486-1.txz:  Removed.
  The name of this package has been changed to "gptfdisk".
a/gptfdisk-0.8.5-i486-1.txz:  Added.
  This is the updated version of gdisk, which got a name change upstream.
  It has added two new programs: cgfdisk, which is a menu driven GPT fdisk
  similar to cfdisk, and fixparts, a tool for repairing corrupted GPT tables.
  Thanks to Robert Easter for the heads-up on this.
a/kernel-firmware-20120804git-noarch-1.txz:  Upgraded.

d/binutils-2.22.52.0.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added i386-efi-pe target, needed to compile some EFI bootloaders.
  Thanks to Franck Barbenoire.
x/xf86-video-nv-2.1.20-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This driver was supposedly deprecated a couple of years ago, but there's a
  new version out and so we'll upgrade since some people still use this simple
  non-KMS driver and there's been a report of a segfault with the previous
  version.  Thanks to Ken L.
xap/blackbox-0.70.1-i486-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.
  However, this still does not allow users to mount with Thunar, or to make
  adjustments to nm-applet, and running polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
  didn't help.  Maybe it's not possible to get all this FDo/XDG fluff working
  with the minimalist WMs and I'm not sure most people using them will care
  all that much.  A greater proportion might be unhappy to see dbus and
  consolekit polluting the process table, to be honest.  Anyway, if someone
  has a solution that makes all this stuff work, I'm willing to take another
  look.  For now, at least, there's no conflict with XDM, and it's probably
  closer to actually working than it was before.
xap/fluxbox-1.3.2-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.
xap/fvwm-2.6.5-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  Added new gptfdisk utilities.
  Added /lib/modprobe.d/ and default blacklist files.
usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Rebuilt.
  Added new gptfdisk utilities.

  symlink.  Thanks to Josiah Boothby.
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug  1 20:24:06 UTC 2012
a/dbus-1.4.20-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched rc.messagebus to restart the system D-Bus daemon even if a user
  daemon is running (as it does now with X11 sessions).
  Thanks to Darren Austin.
a/sysvinit-2.88dsf-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed paths.h for /etc/forcefsck and /etc/fastboot.
  Thanks to Ken Milmore.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-5.txz:  Rebuilt.

  Recompiled --without-gsettings, which should fix runtime complaints.
  Thanks to GazL on LQ.
xap/xpdf-3.02pl6-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix slow scrolling caused by a quirk exposed in newer versions
  of gcc.  Patch by Michael Gilbert.  Thanks to LQ for pointing it out.
extra/google-chrome/google-chrome.SlackBuild:  Modified.
  Allow $ARCH to be preset before running the script.  This is useful for
  systems running a 32-bit userspace under a 64-bit kernel, perhaps in a
  chroot environment.  Thanks to Zhu Qun-Ying.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 30 20:42:03 UTC 2012
a/udev-182-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Since many people blacklist aaa_base when upgrading with slackpkg, add a
  top-level /run directory to prevent problems.
l/gsettings-desktop-schemas-3.4.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Since this requires /usr/lib64 on x86_64, the package should not be built
  as "noarch".  Thanks to Eugene Wissner.
l/libdbusmenu-qt-0.9.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Relocate documentation.
n/curl-7.27.0-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.

n/bind-9.9.1_P2-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using
  "Bad cache" data before it has been initialized.  [RT #30025]
  ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a
  race condition that could cause a memory leak.  This rarely occurred
  with UDP clients, but could be a significant problem for a server
  handling a steady rate of TCP queries.  [RT #29539 & #30233]
  Under heavy incoming TCP query loads named could experience a
  memory leak which could lead to significant reductions in query
  response or cause the server to be terminated on systems with
  "out of memory" killers. [RT #29539]
  A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length
  RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of
  the named process.  [RT #29644]

Howdy!  Lots of shiny stuff here, including the long awaited Xfce 4.10!
Thanks to Robby Workman for the initial set of build scripts, and lots
of testing (plus some very helpful notes about things such as the proper
build order).  I'm calling this a beta (finally!), and it's really very
close to what we expect to release.  Test away.
BTW, Mercury leaves retrograde on August 8th, position 01:26 Leo.  ;-)

  Show the date after setting the system clock.
  Thanks to Darrell Anderson.
  Shut down udev in rc.6.  Thanks to Robby Workman.
  In rc.S, determine the actual root partition and insert it into /etc/mtab
  so that "/dev/root" isn't shown when booting a kernel without an initrd.
  I should have fixed this years ago.
a/udev-182-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, udev in this devel cycle has certainly been interesting!  A fair
  number of odd bug reports have been coming in, and we hadn't really been
  able to get a handle on the source of the issues.  Quite some time ago
  we started testing udev-182, and noticed that it caused some issues with
  the persistent net and cd rules.  There'd sometimes be two entries per
  device, so a machine with a single Ethernet card might come up showing the
  card as eth1, with two rules in 70-persistent-net.rules (eth0 and eth1).
  We tested a lot of udev versions trying to determine where the problem
  started, and it seemed to begin with version 176, the first one that
  used libkmod rather than calling out to module-init-tools to load modules.
  Asking upstream about it, they suggested that we just turn the generation
  of persistent rules off.  They'd already turned it off by default.  "Make
  'em make rules!" seemed to be the answer, and since I remember well why
  the autogeneration of net and CD rules came about, I wasn't really happy
  with that answer.  After deploying the "safe" upgrade to 175, we got a
  couple of reports of this same issue happening (though none of us could
  reproduce the issue with 175).  Robby ended up making some patches to
  the rule writing scripts for udev-182 that were able to stop the doubling
  up of rules, but the devices themselves would still be misnumbered on the
  first boot without rules, and would then be correct after a reboot.
    Last week I sat down determined to figure out where the race condition
  was.  After endless reboots with various tests, I got the idea to put my
  network modules on the initrd and have it shell out so that I could take
  a look at them.  What I found was that the rules were generated correctly
  on the initrd.  Well, that was a surprise, but I must have had some kind
  of hunch to even try a test like that.  On another hunch, I ran
  "pstree -c -p | grep udevd" on the running system.  Heh.  There it was.
  We had been running two copies of udevd, and they were fighting it out.
  At some point along the line, udevd was changed.  It used to be that if
  you tried to start a second copy it wouldn't start, and would exit with
  status 1, and our rc.udev script relied on this behavior.  Fixing the
  problem was considerably easier than finding it...  rworkman and I made
  some changes in rc.udev to check if udevd was already running instead
  of expecting it to check for itself.  Another change was required to
  cause it to write out rules if they didn't exist already, and then to
  read them back in (otherwise optical symlinks were still missing on first
  boot without rules).  There's still one issue that was also present with
  udev-175, which is that a hotplugged optical drive won't get symlinks
  unless it has been in at boot and had rules generated for it then.
  Otherwise, things are looking considerably better.  Firmware is loading
  correctly, rules are autogenerated properly again, and several devices
  that were missing in /dev have returned.
    So, there's the story.  Maybe more than you really wanted to know.  ;-)
  Thanks to rworkman for his help on this.  Please report any new problems.
  And if anyone knows how to get symlinks working for a hotplugged optical
  drive like they did in udev-165, a fix would be most appreciated.

Fri Jul 13 23:14:15 UTC 2012
It's Friday the 13th, and Mercury is going into retrograde...  seems like the
perfect time to break things!  A few notes are in order here...   first, we've
switched to using openssl-1.0.1c, which changes the major number for the
crypto and ssl libraries from .0 to .1, meaning everything linked with the
previous version of openssl will need to be recompiled.  The
lib{crypto,ssl}.so.0 libraries were backed up into aaa_elflibs, but this only
means that binaries linked with those libraries will start, not that SSL will
continue to work for them.  The hashing format in /etc/ssl/certs/ has changed,
so any programs linking to the old libraries will not be able to use them.
Next, Java has gone away due to licensing restrictions...  Finally, these
changes have broken Xfce as it exists in -current at the moment, but I'll try
to do something about that soon.  Thanks to Robby Workman and Eric Hameleers
for lots of help on these updates!

  Changes to configuration:
  CONFIG_SCSI_ISCSI_ATTRS=m
  # CONFIG_BCMA is not set
  CONFIG_BRCMSMAC=m
  CONFIG_SCSI_ISCSI_ATTRS was made modular since the iSCSI userspace will not
  work with it built in.  This change disallows building the QLogic 40xx
  (ISP4XXX) and 8022 (ISP82XX) into the huge kernel, but for the same reason
  those would not have worked for installation anyway.
  CONFIG_BCMA was turned off because including it prevents building the
  Broadcom BRCMSMAC driver, which is the only working choice for several
  adapters other than the proprietary wl driver.  Unfortunately, removing
  BCMA removes support for bcm4331 from the b43 driver.  However, adding the
  BRCMSMAC causes several new adaptors to gain support, including some that
  are becoming quite common in recent laptops, so overall this change should
  be a net gain.

xap/sane-1.0.22-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix compiling against v4l-utils.
  Changed udev rules to use group lp instead of scanner.  It turns out that
  this is likely what's been interfering with printer detection since we
  switched CUPS to use libusb instead of the usblp kernel module.  SANE
  would come along and switch the group on multifunction printer/scanners
  to "scanner", and then CUPS would no longer be able to use them.  The
  kernel module wasn't affected by this since it didn't use the raw USB
  device node and didn't care who owned it.  Anyway, making this switch
  gets things pretty close to how they were before.  The good news is that
  printers should be detected and configurable without having to look at
  lsusb output or writing custom udev rules, however, users will need to
  be in group lp in order to use the scanner.  We'll do this automatically
  for console logins.

a/shadow-4.1.4.3-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Default to SHA256 encryption for /etc/shadow on new installations.
  HINT:  You might want to make this change in an existing /etc/login.defs:
    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA256
  or even this, if the increased CPU time is not an issue:
    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
n/lynx-2.8.7-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added --enable-ipv6.  Thanks to DrBerlin.
xap/blueman-r708-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Switched back to r708, since the newer repo pull is requiring PulseAudio.
  We'll consider what to do about this long term sometime down the road.

a/kernel-huge-3.2.21-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Removed built-in support for legacy Megaraid driver, as it interferes with
  the drivers for newer cards.  In fact, most Megaraid cards that are not
  _very_ old will work with the newer megaraid_box driver.  Systems older
  than that can still be upgraded to -current (or Slackware-next) and will
  work fine using megaraid.ko and an appropriate initrd (we will still
  provide the legacy module for the generic kernel).  Hopefully this
  inconvenience will not affect too many users, but a choice needed to be
  made in the installer one way or the other, and it seemed better to support
  new cards than obsolete ones.

  Patch to avoid prototype errors with recent perl (the reason that I'd tried
  to use 1.12.1).

As you've possibly noticed by now, slackware.com is back on the air, and
I'd like to take this opportunity to give a hearty thanks to Mark Post of
Slack/390 fame for updating the PHP code to make it happen!  Eric Hameleers
and the rest of the crew also pitched in to help get it installed and
running on our other server.  Thanks as well to all the folks who emailed
with offers of hardware, help porting, and other support for the site.
We really appreciated it.  Viva la vie Slackware!

Still a few things in need of a rebuild for perl, such as perlkde,
perlqt, and linuxdoc-tools, but I'd rather not leave things in a
known-broken state so most everything else should be fixed now.
There's a couple of other updates, and a patch to glibc that I'm
hoping will fix the reported crashes with Google Chrome.

n/php-5.4.3-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added --enable-maintainer-zts to the ./configure options.
  It seems that this option was automatically enabled on the 64-bit side,
  but not on 32-bit.  I'm still not entirely sure why that happened.  I
  had a few theories about it, like perhaps httpd was running when one of
  the PHP packages was compiled, but testing on 32-bit seemed to engage
  ZTS at random.  The only reliable way to make things work was to specify
  the option explicitly, so that's what has been done.  If it has to be
  one way or the other, I think we want a thread-safe PHP that will work
  with any httpd MPM.  Let me know if there are still any issues, but it
  should be working properly now.

Well, it appears that going from perl-5.14.x to perl-5.16.x did indeed
cause some packages that use perl to break.  The first two reports are
a couple of usual suspects, irssi and xchat.  Probably there are more
that need an upgrade or recompile, such as:  git, imagemagick, linuxdoc-tools,
net-snmp, obexftp, perlkde, perlqt, pidgin, pilot-link, subversion, and swig.
Confirmations on any of these appreciated.  I notice that some of these
also use Python, so maybe we should just go to Python-2.7.3 first and get
the breakage over with all at once?

Hey folks!  We've merged KDE 4.8.2 and a bunch of new packages that it
depends upon into -current, thanks in large part to months of work and
testing by Eric Hameleers.  Note that NetworkManager is included.  If
you want to use this, make sure to move the new rc.M into place,
make /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager executable, and then add the KDE
"Network Manager" widget to your desktop.  Have fun!  :-)
NOTE:  After upgrading, the following obsolete KDE packages should be removed:
  kdeaccessibility, kdebase, kdebase-runtime, kdebase-workspace,
  kdebindings, kdeedu, kdegraphics, kdeutils, koffice, konq-plugins,
  kopete-cryptography, polkit-kde-1, and all koffice-l10n-*.

  Use genuine GNU bash instead of busybox ash.  This fixes installer failure
  caused by exported variables such as TERM failing to propogate to subshells.
  I'm still not sure what's causing that issue (perhaps a change in glibc?),
  but using real bash might be better in the long run, as we won't need to
  avoid bashisms in the scripts.  The original reason bash was avoided was to
  keep things small for installer floppies, and we're well past that era.

  to trigger the glibc bug within vsftpd, the non-default option
  "chroot_local_user" must be set in /etc/vsftpd.conf.
  Considered 1) low severity (hard to exploit) and 2) not a vsftpd bug :-)

equipment, upstream targets, and reality all seem to be settling down
enough to get these updates out and have them be an actual improvement
over what's already up.  Hope to have more soon.  Cheers!

  These are the main configuration changes from the 2.6.37.6 kernel in 13.37:
    BLK_DEV_LOOP y -> m
    HIGHMEM4G y -> n
    HIGHMEM64G n -> y
    LOG_BUF_SHIFT 15 -> 18
    M686 y -> n
    MPENTIUMIII n -> y
    MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH n -> y
  And, compared with the 2.6.38.4 kernel in 13.37/testing:
    LOG_BUF_SHIFT 15 -> 18
    M686 y -> n
    MPENTIUMIII n -> y
    PREEMPT_NONE y -> n
    PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY n -> y
    SCHED_AUTOGROUP y -> n
  It remains to be seen where the PREEMPT_* options will settle in the future.
  SCHED_AUTOGROUP still seems sketchy to me, and might be behind some odd
  clockskew issues.  And, thanks to Carl Wenninger for reporting that the
  LOG_BUF_SHIFT setting was less than the kernel defaults and was leading to
  a few missing lines at the beginning of 'dmesg' output.

  Revert ABI breakage in 2.2.18 caused by the function signature change
  of ap_unescape_url_keep2f().  This release restores the signature from
  2.2.17 and prior, and introduces ap_unescape_url_keep2f_ex().
  Apache httpd-2.2.18 is considered abandoned.  All users must upgrade.

l/apr-1.4.4-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This fixes a possible denial of service due to an unconstrained, recursive
  invocation of apr_fnmatch().  This function has been reimplemented using a
  non-recursive algorithm.  Thanks to William Rowe.

n/httpd-2.2.18-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bug fix release, but since the upgrades to apr/apr-util require at
  least an httpd recompile we opted to upgrade to the newest httpd.

Slackware 13.37 x86 stable is released!

Thanks to everyone who pitched in on this release: the Slackware team,
the folks producing upstream code, and linuxquestions.org for providing
a great forum for collaboration and testing.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

As always, thanks to the Slackware community for testing, suggestions,
and feedback.  :-)

Have fun!
