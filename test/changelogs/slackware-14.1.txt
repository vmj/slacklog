patches/packages/git-2.14.4-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo
  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../" into the
  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause
  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).
  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.
  It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS
  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).
  Credit for fixing for these bugs goes to Jeff King, Johannes
  Schindelin and others.

patches/packages/libXcursor-1.1.15-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot
  the system).

  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

  This update fixes two security issues found in bash before 4.4:
  The expansion of '\h' in the prompt string allows remote authenticated users
  to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters placed in 'hostname' of a
  machine. The theoretical attack vector is a hostile DHCP server providing a
  crafted hostname, but this is unlikely to occur in a normal Slackware
  configuration as we ignore the hostname provided by DHCP.
  Specially crafted SHELLOPTS+PS4 environment variables used against bogus
  setuid binaries using system()/popen() allowed local attackers to execute
  arbitrary code as root.

patches/packages/xorg-server-1.14.3-i486-4_slack14.1.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update fixes two security issues:
  A user authenticated to an X Session could crash or execute code in the
  context of the X Server by exploiting a stack overflow in the endianness
  conversion of X Events.
  Uninitialized data in endianness conversion in the XEvent handling of the
  X.Org X Server allowed authenticated malicious users to access potentially
  privileged data from the X server.

patches/packages/git-2.14.1-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

  Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and could
  be abused to write to files outside the repository.
  Mercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing
  shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname starting

patches/packages/linux-3.10.107/*:  Upgraded.
  This kernel fixes two "Stack Clash" vulnerabilities reported by Qualys.
  The first issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated
  privileges. Failed attack attempts will likely result in denial-of-service
  conditions. The second issue can be exploited to bypass certain security
  restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P5-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

patches/packages/libpng-1.4.20-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial

  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

  unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to
  otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on
  the system.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

patches/packages/linux-3.10.103/*:  Upgraded.
  A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernels handling of
  networking challenge ack where an attacker is able to determine the shared
  counter.  This may allow an attacker located on different subnet to inject
  or take over a TCP connection between a server and client without having to
  be a traditional Man In the Middle (MITM) style attack.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

  Client side SMB2/3 required signing can be downgraded.
  It's possible for an attacker to downgrade the required signing for an

  SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flags.  This means that the attacker can
  impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return malicious

patches/packages/wget-1.18-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions
  of wget.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would
  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the
  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works
  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original
  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the
  user must provide --trust-server-names.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by
  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.

  generation for the diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14
  methods, ephemeral secret keys of size 128 bits are generated, instead
  of the recommended sizes of 1024 and 2048 bits, giving a practical

patches/packages/glibc-2.17-i486-11_slack14.1.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update provides a patch to fix the stack-based buffer overflow in
  libresolv that could allow specially crafted DNS responses to seize
  control of execution flow in the DNS client (CVE-2015-7547).  However,
  due to a patch applied to Slackware's glibc back in 2009 (don't use the
  gethostbyname4() lookup method as it was causing some cheap routers to
  misbehave), we were not vulnerable to that issue.  Nevertheless it seems
  prudent to patch the overflows anyway even if we're not currently using
  the code in question.  Thanks to mancha for the backported patch.

  could be reusing a proxy connection using the previously used credentials

  wasn't intended to.  Thanks to Isaac Boukris.

  PHP 5.4.x has been declared EOL (end of life) and is no longer receiving
  upstream support.  PHP 5.5.x is also no longer on active support status and
  security fixes will continue only until 5 months from now.  For this reason
  we have provided PHP 5.6 packages as security updates.  Be aware that PHP
  5.6 is not 100% compatible with PHP 5.4, and some changes may be required
  to existing web pages written for PHP 5.4.
  For information on how to migrate from PHP 5.4, please see:

patches/packages/openssh-7.1p2-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an information leak and a buffer overflow.  In particular,
  the information leak allows a malicious SSH server to steal the client's
  private keys.  Thanks to Qualys for reporting this issue.
  For more information, see:

  *****************************************************************
  * IMPORTANT:  READ BELOW ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES *
  *****************************************************************
  Rather than backport the fix for the information leak (which is the only
  hazardous flaw), we have upgraded to the latest OpenSSH.  As of version
  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)
  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,
  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and
  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system
  after the upgrade.
  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes
  to be aware of:
  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
    default at compile time.
  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
    changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
    were enabled).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P3-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes two denial-of-service vulnerabilities:
  + CVE-2015-5722 is a denial-of-service vector which can be
  exploited remotely against a BIND server that is performing
  validation on DNSSEC-signed records.  Validating recursive
  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not
  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an
  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers
  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,
  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to
  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.
  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.
  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used
  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation
  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk
  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could
  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under
  limited conditions.
  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to
  CVE-2015-5986.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P2-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an error in the handling of TKEY
  queries can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service
  vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE
  assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.
  Impact:
  Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this defect.
  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration
  options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs
  early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.
  Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as soon as
  possible.

patches/packages/openssl-1.0.1p-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes the following security issue:
  Alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793).
  During certificate verification, OpenSSL (starting from version 1.0.1n and
  1.0.2b) will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first
  attempt to build such a chain fails.  An error in the implementation of this
  logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted
  certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a
  valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.
  This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including
  SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.
  This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o.
  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 24th June 2015 by Adam Langley/David
  Benjamin (Google/BoringSSL).  The fix was developed by the BoringSSL project.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P1-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an attacker who can cause
  a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed
  contents can cause that resolver to fail an assertion and terminate due
  to a defect in validation code.  This means that a recursive resolver that
  is performing DNSSEC validation can be deliberately stopped by an attacker
  who can cause the resolver to perform a query against a
  maliciously-constructed zone.  This will result in a denial of service to
  clients who rely on that resolver.

  This update fixes a security issue where under specific circumstances an
  attacker can send a crafted packet to cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to
  crash.  Since this requires 1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration
  (not allowed by default), and 2) knowledge of the configuration password,
  and 3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration,
  the vulnerability is considered low-risk.

patches/packages/samba-4.1.16-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update is a security release in order to address CVE-2014-8143
  (Elevation of privilege to Active Directory Domain Controller).
  Samba's AD DC allows the administrator to delegate creation of user or
  computer accounts to specific users or groups.  However, all released
  versions of Samba's AD DC did not implement the additional required
  check on the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT bit in the userAccountControl
  attributes.  Most Samba deployments are not of the AD Domain Controller,
  but are of the classic domain controller, the file server or print server.
  Only the Active Directory Domain Controller is affected by this issue.
  Additionally, most sites running the AD Domain Controller do not configure
  delegation for the creation of user or computer accounts, and so are not
  vulnerable to this issue, as no writes are permitted to the
  userAccountControl attribute, no matter what the value.

patches/packages/openssl-1.0.1j-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  SRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513):
    A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
    sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
    to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):
    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
    attack.
  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:
    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
    downgrade.
    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):
    When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.

patches/packages/bash-4.2.050-i486-1_slack14.1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Another bash update.  Here's some information included with the patch:
    "This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid
    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment
    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell
    function."
  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser
  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%
  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,
  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break
  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as
  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another
  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,
  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).
  Thanks to Florian Weimer and Chet Ramey.

  password changes, such as are available over multiple SAMR and RAP
  interfaces, allowing password guessing attacks.
  CVE-2013-6442:
  Samba versions 4.0.0 and above have a flaw in the smbcacls command. If
  smbcacls is used with the "-C|--chown name" or "-G|--chgrp name"
  command options it will remove the existing ACL on the object being

  Shadow 4.1.5 addressed a tty-hijacking vulnerability in "su -c"
  (CVE-2005-4890) by detaching the controlling terminal in the non-PAM
  case via a TIOCNOTTY request.  Bi-directional protection is excessive
  and breaks a commonly-used methods for privilege escalation on non-PAM
  systems (e.g. xterm -e /bin/su -s /bin/bash -c /bin/bash myscript).
  This update relaxes the restriction and only detaches the controlling
  tty when the callee is not root (which is, after all, the threat vector).

  "ntpdc -c monlist" command can be used to amplify network traffic as part
  of a denial of service attack.  By default, Slackware is not vulnerable
  since it includes "noquery" as a default restriction.  However, it is
  vulnerable if this restriction is removed.  To help mitigate this flaw,
  "disable monitor" has been added to the default ntp.conf (which will disable
  the monlist command even if other queries are allowed), and the default
  restrictions have been extended to IPv6 as well.
  All users of the NTP daemon should make sure that their ntp.conf contains
  "disable monitor" to prevent misuse of the NTP service.  The new ntp.conf
  file will be installed as /etc/ntp.conf.new with a package upgrade, but the
  changes will need to be merged into any existing ntp.conf file by the admin.

Here are a few more updates and bugfixes.  The small networking utilities
should be safe upgrades (thanks to Luiz Gustavo).  I'd thought about Samba
4.1 before the rc (and some more afterwards), and after testing it here
without any issues decided we should try it out.  The Samba project is
known for very high quality releases, so I don't believe we'll be stung by
a .0 version here.  The kernels were rebuilt to fix a regression that
occurred when the 3.10.0 kernel changed CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST to
CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST, which caused some previously included VMWare and
Hyper-V drivers to not be built.  These are the changed kernel options:
   HYPERVISOR_GUEST n -> y
  +FB_HYPERV n
  +HID_HYPERV_MOUSE m
  +HYPERV m
  +HYPERV_BALLOON m
  +HYPERV_NET m
  +HYPERV_STORAGE m
  +HYPERV_UTILS m
  +PARAVIRT n
  +VMWARE_BALLOON m
  +XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST n
Thanks to Victor Miasnikov for the bug report.

And with this batch of updates and fixes (clearing the rest of the
important stuff from the TODO list), we have arrived at Slackware 14.1
release candidate 1!  Please test and report any remaining issues.
UEFI (with the exception of Secure Boot, which will have to wait until
we have real hardware) should be fully implemented in the installer now,
which will detect and warn about common problems, set up the EFI System
Partition under /boot/efi, and install ELILO and a UEFI boot entry
automatically.  There's a new README_UEFI.TXT file with detailed
instructions for installing 64-bit Slackware on UEFI (32-bit won't
support native UEFI due to the mismatch between 64-bit UEFI firmware and
a 32-bit kernel, so Legacy BIOS will be the only way to install 32-bit
Slackware on UEFI).  Several useful netfilter and networking utilities
have been added (thanks to Robby Workman and /dev/rob0 for these).
With this batch of updates, everything should be considered frozen
(including the kernel) unless there's a good reason to change something.
Enjoy!  See you all for the release, hopefully soon.  :-)

A new source option has been added to the installer (install the packages
from a USB stick).  The packages are expected to be found in
/slackware-$VERSION/slackware/, or /slackware/.  The usbimg2disk.sh script
has been slightly modified since it no longer needs to make changes to the

a/efibootmgr-0.5.4-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, reverted to an older version really.  :)  It was reported that
  efibootmgr-0.6.0 was silently failing to actually write the new variables
  to EFI, but that 0.5.4 works.  I'm currently unable to test this here as I'm
  still using DUET UEFI, and changes to the UEFI variables do not persist
  between boots.  I also added a few patches from Fedora's repo that seem
  reasonable to include.  The old (newer) version was moved to /testing in
  case it might work better for someone.
  Thanks to John Yost for the bug report.

  Patched to remove pt_chown.  Thanks to mancha.
  Note that while this patches CVE-2013-2207 (a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability), the vulnerability depends upon insecure and non-default
  settings ("user_allow_other" in /etc/fuse.conf) and the patch is not
  trivial to port to older versions of glibc.  For older versions, the
  best approach is to not set that option in fuse.conf, as it likely opens
  up other holes as well.  Another approach to mitigate this is to make
  pt_chown a symlink to /bin/true, as the kernel has handled chowning
  pseudo terminals for a long time and pt_chown isn't needed at all.

Looks like 3.10.x got LTS status, but more importantly fixes the power issue
on resume with some Intel machines.  So, we're bumping the kernel to 3.10.5,
and will stick with that series for the release.  A few more things to look at
before calling this a beta, but it's pretty close.  Enjoy!

n/NetworkManager-0.9.8.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Switched back to dhcpcd instead of dhclient as the default DHCP client in
  the NetworkManager.conf file.  Either one will work, but it's probably
  better to use dhcpcd by default to avoid a nasty surprise for people who
  didn't install the dhcp package since they aren't running a DHCP server.

  This moves immodules.cache (formerly gtk.immodules) under libdir, allowing
  us to drop the hostname triplet patch that was needed for multilib.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
l/gtk+3-3.8.2-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Dropped the host triplet patch since GTK+3 will use a reasonable directory
  for immodules.cache by default.  Fixed the update script to work properly.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.

  This update fixes an issue where XML in PHP does not properly consider

  crafted document that is processed by the xml_parse_into_struct function.

x/xdm-1.1.11-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  After rebuilding this package, several config files had numerous blank
  lines at the beginning.  I suspected the new version of gawk, but reverting
  to the version from Slackware 14.0 didn't help.  So, we'll use awk to strip
  these before building the package.  If anyone knows why this is happening,
  I'd be interested to know what the real fix is rather than just papering
  over the problem.  Thanks to BroX for the bug report.

We've tested the new RAID instructions here, but given our familiarity with
the process it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a few more eyes looking for
bugs.  If you find any, let us know.  Enjoy!  :)

After careful consideration and a lot of testing as the 3.9.x kernel series
has progressed, we have decided to move to the latest kernel.  It should be
a nice improvement over 3.8.13, which as you all know has reached EOL (at
kernel.org anyway...  I do know about Ubuntu's git maintained version).
After the last experience with upgrading 14.0 to a newer LTS kernel, I can't
say that I have too much faith in the idea that LTS kernels can be upgraded
without causing any regressions.  If the kernel we're using in -current
happens to be delared an LTS kernel, sure, that's a nice plus, but I don't
think it's worth rolling all the way back to 3.4.x just to have an LTS kernel.
Anyway, test it out and report any issues!

ap/hplip-3.13.5-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Background the udev hp-config_usb_printer process to avoid long delays.
  Thanks to timkb4cq.
ap/vim-7.3.1087-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Vim patch 7.0.88 rewrote the regexp engine.  Unfortunately the new
  implementation was causing long delays of 10 seconds or more when opening or
  scrolling any file of a type for which vim does color syntax highlighting.
  Patch 7.3.1110 attempted to fix this, and more patches released today
  correct other bugs in this new regexp engine (including patch 7.3.1111 which
  doesn't even fully apply correctly).  Even with all the fixes applied, the
  new engine is grossly inefficient when compared with the old one, and it is
  obvious that vim is running much more slowly even on my fastest machine.
  It seems like the best course of action is to take all the patches before
  the one that changed the regexp engine and then give upstream some time to
  figure this all out.  Thanks to Benjamin Trigona-Harany for the bug report.
l/libffi-3.0.13-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to move the ffi include files back to /usr/include, and patched
  the pkgconfig file to point there as well.  The relocation of the include
  files to be outside of /usr/include worked for programs that used

ap/slackpkg-2.82.0-noarch-9.tgz:  Rebuilt.
  Set DOWNLOAD_ALL=on in slackpkg.conf by default to avoid script failures
  caused by programs (wget is an example) that may require library updates.
  Without this option, a program might be needed again before the supporting

x/wqy-zenhei-font-ttf-0.8.38_1-noarch-2.txz:  Upgraded.
  The package reverts to the 0.8.38 version due to reports that the newer
  version causes rendering issues with Japanese and Korean fonts.  I've
  found many references to this issue online, and have yet to see any
  solution for it besides reverting or removing the wqy-zenhei-font-ttf
  package altogether.  Some people have suggested dropping wqy-zenhei in
  favor of Droid Sans Fallback, but the glyph coverage is not as good with
  that font.  Probably the best solution for now is to go back to the
  version that seems to work (with a patch to the .conf file for
  compatibility with recent versions of fontconfig).

Hey folks, a few more updates are ready.  I'd like to thank everyone who
weighed in on the thread on LQ concerning reverting a few things to more
stable versions.  Your opinions were very helpful.  Here's what was
concluded after careful consideration:
1) kernel:  Stick with 3.8 for now.  It remains a concern that the nVidia
6150SE and nouveau could be broken with kernels above 3.6.1, however.
Does anyone know if the blob fixes the issues?  If not, there may still be
a compelling reason to switch to the 3.4 kernel for the release.  The
release of the 3.9 kernel might be another reason as well, since moving to
a newer branch could bring more problems and would basically require testing
to start again at square one (and then the 3.8 branch would be dead).  But
since we're sticking with 3.8 for now, might as well bump it to 3.8.8.
2) gcc:  I really have not run into any compiler bugs with this.  There was
a single report of issues with the radeon R300 when the kernel was compiled
with 4.8.0, and it wasn't reported on any bug trackers or anywhere else.
None of the other reports of issues could be reproduced here, or were merely
a case of getting rid of -Werror.  I see no reason to downgrade this.
3) xorg-server:  Here, it does appear that going with the better supported
branch (1.13.x) is a good idea to help support external drivers.  Many
people reported when the batch containing 1.14.0 was shipped that things were
working better, but I attribute this to the driver updates that went out at
the same time.  I've moved the 1.14.x (upgraded to 1.14.1) server and the
drivers that were build against it into testing, so anyone that wants to use
that branch is free to continue to do so.  But I think that the average user
is more likely to run into problems with the 1.14.x branch and the lack of
driver support from AMD than they are to require one of the improvements such
as in the area of touch input support.
Thanks again for the advice!

  Patched two crash bugs (CVE-2013-0242, CVE-2013-1914).  These do not allow
  code execution, and upstream agrees that they are low priority/severity.
  They are patched here since glibc was due for a kernel related rebuild
  anyway, but given the low priority/severity and possibility of introducing
  problems in production versions of glibc, they will backported only if
  further review indicates a necessity.

Some more X updates from upstream.  Also, several video drivers that didn't
fail to compile were found to still be using the obsolete and removed
miInitializeBackingStore() function.  One of them was the s3virge driver
that was reported on LQ to not be working...  perhaps it works now?
Thanks to Andrey Panov for the bug report.

a/shadow-4.1.4.3-i486-8.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched pw_encrypt() to fix "crypt:  Invalid argument" and immediate login
  failure when a non-existent user tries to log in.  This was caused by a
  change in the behavior of glibc's crypt() function.  When a user that does
  not exist tries to log in, the code in shadow calls crypt() with an invalid
  salt.  The old version of crypt() used the provided bad salt (always "!")
  to produce a DES hash with "!!" at the beginning, while the new one just
  returns NULL which isn't well-handled by the shadow code.  To fix this
  shadow bug, if the salt is invalid, we'll call crypt() using a good SHA512
  salt, prepend "!!" to the hash that we get back, and have pw_encrypt()
  return this as the result.  The effect is identical to the previous
  behavior -- unless the exact same malformed hash happens to be the hash in
  /etc/shadow (it won't be), the login will fail.  While I see no way that
  these 6 lines of code could be less secure than the original code, I
  welcome additional review.  Also, if anyone spots anything else that was
  adversely affected by the change to crypt()'s behavior, please let me know.
  Thanks to Michael L. Semon for informing me of the /bin/login problem.

More updates, and several rebuilds due to bumped library versions in
the boost, icu4c, ilmbase, imagemagick, libzip, and net-snmp packages.
Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger for several of these library bumps, and to
Robby Workman for the initial work on lots of the updates in this batch.
The big news here is the removal of MySQL in favor of MariaDB.  This
shouldn't really be a surprise on any level.  The poll on LQ showed a large
majority of our users were in favor of the change.  It's my belief that
the MariaDB Foundation will do a better job with the code, be more
responsive to security concerns, and be more willing to work with the
open source community.  And while I don't think there is currently any
issue with MySQL's licensing of the community edition for commercial uses,
several threads on LQ showed that there is confusion about this, whereas
with MariaDB the freedom to use the software is quite clear.  Thanks are
due to Heinz Wiesinger for his work on transitioning the build script,
testing, and getting us all behind this move.  He's been working with
MariaDB (and their developers) for several years now.  Vincent Batts also
had a hand in the early discussions here -- he met Daniel Bartholomew of
MariaDB on a train last year and got a copy of the source to play with to
pass the time on the journey (ah, the miracle of thumbdrives :), and was
impressed with not only MariaDB itself, but also with the welcome that
Slackware was getting.  We expect they'll be responsive to any concerns
we have.  In the vast majority of situations, MariaDB is entirely
compatible with existing MySQL databases and will drop right in with no
changes required.  There's an article available outlining the areas in
which MariaDB differs from MySQL that I'd recommend reading:
  https://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb-versus-mysql-compatibility/
Thanks to the MariaDB Foundation!  We look forward to working with you.

  ISO (instructions in isolinux/README.TXT) and it boots here on VirtualBox.

  Added /EFI/BOOT/ directory containing elilo.
  Thanks to Erik_FL on LQ for pointing out that a boot image for UEFI did not
  need to have a GPT partition table.  Seems it works either way, but since
  GPT is not required that allows us to add the support for UEFI boot to the
  regular USB installer image.  Unfortunately, this image still does not
  work any better (or differently) as an El-Torito boot image for EFI on
  an ISO.  In tests here, elilo loads but runs into an error while loading
  the initrd.  I've experimented with different -boot-load-size options
  (including way too large to be sure the whole image is mapped) but so
  far it has not worked.  If anyone figures out the trick to making this work,
  let me know.  It would be nice to have the DVD bootable under UEFI, and it
  wouldn't take any extra space since the usbboot.img file will be on the
  disc anyway.

Here we go with some more updates...  a few notes on them are in order.
For this kernel update I decided to go with 3.7.10.  Yeah, the 3.7 series
is EOL, but I've heard about some broken drivers in 3.8.x that make me
hesitate to push forward.  Another option might be to move to 3.4.x, which
is working on my machine finally (a clocksource bug was crashing it with
earlier versions).  The USB host and usb-storage drivers are now modular
in both the huge and generic kernels to avoid an issue where a USB stick
could be assigned /dev/sda when running the huge kernel.  The brcmsmac
driver for Broadcom wifi is built.  However, this takes over for any
Broadcom card that it can support -- those cards will no longer be supported
by the b43 driver.  So, if you're currently using b43 and find that it no
longer works, you'll need to move to the brcmsmac driver instead.  It's
technically possible to build these with the overlapping support, but it's
a mess that way which is probably why nobody else is doing that.  And finally,
rudimentary UEFI support makes its first appearance in -current in the form
of a bootable USB image called efiboot.img.  Still no support in the
installer for setting up elilo, but this will at least get Linux installed
without the need for Legacy BIOS support.  Looking into how to set up the
boot support in the installer will be the next order of business, and I
have a few different ideas about the way to go about that...  probably
some good material for a discussion on LQ.  BTW, a GPT FAT image like this
one is _supposed_ to work as an El-Torito alternate boot image when creating
an ISO image (extra mkisofs options: -eltorito-alt-boot -no-emul-boot
-eltorito-platform 0xEF -eltorito-boot usb-and-pxe-installers/efiboot.img),
but it's mostly not working here.  I did get one of these to work when booted
from an ISO, but all the attempts after that failed.  Looks like it might be
a problem with the -boot-load-size being detected properly for one magic
EFI image and not for all the others.  If anyone is brave or bored enough to
look into that, hints are gratefully accepted.  Anyway, that's it for now.
Have fun!

isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  This adds support for kernel mode setting video, needed to have any text
  output with some UEFI implementations.  If you need to bypass this, use
  the "nomodeset" option at the boot prompt.
  Terminus fonts were added to avoid small KMS text (bypass with "nofont").
  USB host and usb-storage modules were added since those are no longer built
  into the huge kernels.
  The hv_storvsc.ko module was added to support installing in Hyper-V.

  This is a USB installer image that can be booted from UEFI.

  Don't include /usr/share/fonts in the fonts.conf font directory list as that
  causes bitmapped fonts to be used.  Thanks to Iouri Kharon.

Lots of X updates in this batch!  We were finally able to upgrade to the
latest cairo (including the long-requested XCB backend), as the text
corruption bug that was preventing that was fixed in the upstream X server.
We've also upgraded to the latest libdrm and Mesa.  Don't miss the new glu
package -- that was previously part of Mesa, and there are a lot of things
that link to it.  Thanks to Robby Workman for all the help with this.

a/elilo-3.14-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Include the x64 bootloader, not the Itanium one.  Thanks to cendryon.
  We're also keeping the ia32 version, even though 32-bit UEFI is
  practically unknown.  There might be some 32-bit EFI implementations
  out there, so it doesn't hurt to have it.
ap/hplip-3.13.2-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/polkit-0.105-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Reverted a patch that set the members of the wheel group as the
  authorized administrators.  On Slackware, root is the administrator
  and the wheel group is mostly unused.  Thanks to Grard Monpontet.
xap/pidgin-2.10.7-i486-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed linking libirc.so with libsasl2.
  Added Makefile.in and Makefile to the patch, and applied it after
  running ./configure.  Using autoreconf is not an option since most
  versions of Slackware aren't using the same libtools versions as the
  Pidgin developers are.  Third times the charm?
  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.

  Fixed IRC support.  When building with SASL support (new in 2.10.7), the
  IRC plugin needs to link against libsasl2, otherwise it will fail to load.

  This bumps the shared library version number, and will require
  several other packages to be recompiled.  This will be done after
  there's been some time to test this in -current.  Meanwhile, things
  should continue to work normally with the old shared library in
  the aaa_elflibs package.
d/git-1.8.1.3-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/QScintilla-2.6.1-i486-4.txz:  Rebuilt.

xap/pidgin-2.10.7-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  Remote MXit user could specify local file path.
  MXit buffer overflow reading data from network.
  Sametime crash with long user IDs.
  Crash when receiving a UPnP response with abnormally long values.

  Thanks go to Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson of the Information
  Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London
  (www.isg.rhul.ac.uk) for discovering this flaw and Adam Langley and

    Fix flaw in AESNI handling of TLS 1.2 and 1.1 records for CBC mode
  ciphersuites which can be exploited in a denial of service attack.
  Thanks go to and to Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> for discovering
  and detecting this bug and to Wolfgang Ettlinger
  <wolfgang.ettlinger@gmail.com> for independently discovering this issue.

n/curl-7.29.0-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.  This vulnerability
  can be exploited by someone who is in control of a server that a libcurl
  based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or IMAP.  For applications
  that accept user provided URLs, it is also thinkable that a malicious
  user would feed an application with a URL to a server hosting code
  targeting this flaw.
  Affected versions: curl 7.26.0 to and including 7.28.1

a/udev-182-i486-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  The upgrade to the 3.7.1 kernel broke the generation of persistent optical
  device rules, and existing rules in 70-persistent-cd.rules no longer worked.
  This update fixes the issue by basing the rules on ID_SERIAL rather than
  ID_PATH (which is not supported by the new kernel's libata transport class).
  After upgrading the package, remove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules
  and reboot the machine.  This will create a working rules file and restore
  the expected symbolic links to optical devices in /dev.

  Added support for the parameter names that control the delay before

  'rootdelay' 'rootfstype' respectively.  These are the official/documented
  parameters in the kernel documentation.  The original parameters ('rootfs'
  and 'waitforroot') may still be used.
  Thanks to Thorsten Mhlfelder and Richard Lapointe for the suggestion.
  For ARM devices: unless specified when the initrd is built, or at boot
  time as a kernel parameter, wait a minimum of four seconds for the root
  device to become ready.

Slackware 14.0 x86 stable is released!

We're perfectionists here at Slackware, so this release has been a long
time a-brewing.  But we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait.
Slackware 14.0 combines modern components, ease of use, and flexible
configuration... our "KISS" philosophy demands it.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the
upstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.

Have fun!  :-)
