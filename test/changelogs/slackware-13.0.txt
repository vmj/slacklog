  Sanitize the diagnostic output of the original file name in verbose mode.
  By using a made up file name in the message it was possible to fake status
  messages. Using this technique it was for example possible to fake the
  verification status of a signed mail.

patches/packages/git-2.14.4-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo
  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../" into the
  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause
  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).
  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.
  It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS
  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).
  Credit for fixing for these bugs goes to Jeff King, Johannes
  Schindelin and others.

patches/packages/libXcursor-1.1.15-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot
  the system).

  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P5-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

patches/packages/libpng-1.2.57-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

patches/packages/openssh-7.4p1-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P4-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.9_P3-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  Testing by ISC has
  uncovered a critical error condition which can occur when a nameserver is
  constructing a response.  A defect in the rendering of messages into
  packets can cause named to exit with an assertion failure in buffer.c while
  constructing a response to a query that meets certain criteria.

patches/packages/wget-1.18-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions
  of wget.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would
  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the
  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works
  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original
  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the
  user must provide --trust-server-names.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by
  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.

patches/packages/curl-7.47.1-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where NTLM credentials are not checked
  for proxy connection reuse.  The effects of this flaw is that the application
  could be reusing a proxy connection using the previously used credentials
  and thus it could be given to or prevented access from resources that it
  wasn't intended to.  Thanks to Isaac Boukris.

patches/packages/openssh-7.1p2-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an information leak and a buffer overflow.  In particular,
  the information leak allows a malicious SSH server to steal the client's
  private keys.  Thanks to Qualys for reporting this issue.
  For more information, see:
    https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt

  *****************************************************************
  * IMPORTANT:  READ BELOW ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES *
  *****************************************************************
  Rather than backport the fix for the information leak (which is the only
  hazardous flaw), we have upgraded to the latest OpenSSH.  As of version
  7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)
  algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,
  hostbased and GSSAPI authentication.  Make sure that your keys and
  authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system
  after the upgrade.
  The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes
  to be aware of:
  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
    default at compile time.
  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
    is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
    the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
    by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
    instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
    changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
    interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
    hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
    keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
    were enabled).

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P3-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes two denial-of-service vulnerabilities:
  + CVE-2015-5722 is a denial-of-service vector which can be
  exploited remotely against a BIND server that is performing
  validation on DNSSEC-signed records.  Validating recursive
  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not
  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an
  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers
  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,
  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to
  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.
  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.
  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used
  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation
  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk
  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could
  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under
  limited conditions.
  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to
  CVE-2015-5986.

patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P2-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an error in the handling of TKEY
  queries can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service
  vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE
  assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.
  Impact:
  Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this defect.
  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration
  options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs
  early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.
  Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as soon as
  possible.

Tue Jul  7 22:59:17 UTC 2015
patches/packages/bind-9.9.7_P1-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an attacker who can cause
  a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed
  contents can cause that resolver to fail an assertion and terminate due
  to a defect in validation code.  This means that a recursive resolver that
  is performing DNSSEC validation can be deliberately stopped by an attacker
  who can cause the resolver to perform a query against a
  maliciously-constructed zone.  This will result in a denial of service to
  clients who rely on that resolver.

patches/packages/ntp-4.2.8p3-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where under specific circumstances an
  attacker can send a crafted packet to cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to
  crash.  Since this requires 1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration
  (not allowed by default), and 2) knowledge of the configuration password,
  and 3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration,
  the vulnerability is considered low-risk.

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssl-0.9.8zc-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  SRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513):
    A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
    sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
    to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):
    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
    attack.
  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:
    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
    downgrade.
    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):
    When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.

patches/packages/bash-3.1.020-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  Another bash update.  Here's some information included with the patch:
    "This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid
    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment
    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell
    function."
  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser
  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%
  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,
  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break
  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as
  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another
  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,
  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/ntp-4.2.6p5-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  All stable versions of NTP remain vulnerable to a remote attack where the
  "ntpdc -c monlist" command can be used to amplify network traffic as part
  of a denial of service attack.  By default, Slackware is not vulnerable
  since it includes "noquery" as a default restriction.  However, it is
  vulnerable if this restriction is removed.  To help mitigate this flaw,
  "disable monitor" has been added to the default ntp.conf (which will disable
  the monlist command even if other queries are allowed), and the default
  restrictions have been extended to IPv6 as well.
  All users of the NTP daemon should make sure that their ntp.conf contains
  "disable monitor" to prevent misuse of the NTP service.  The new ntp.conf
  file will be installed as /etc/ntp.conf.new with a package upgrade, but the
  changes will need to be merged into any existing ntp.conf file by the admin.

  Fixed linking libirc.so with libsasl2.
  Added Makefile.in and Makefile to the patch, and applied it after
  running ./configure.  Using autoreconf is not an option since most
  versions of Slackware aren't using the same libtools versions as the
  Pidgin developers are.  Third times the charm?
  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.

  Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using
  "Bad cache" data before it has been initialized.  [RT #30025]
  ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a

  Minor version bump, this also works around a hard to trigger heap overflow

  to trigger the glibc bug within vsftpd, the non-default option
  "chroot_local_user" must be set in /etc/vsftpd.conf.
  Considered 1) low severity (hard to exploit) and 2) not a vsftpd bug :-)

  For those upgrading from PHP 5.2.x, be aware that quite a bit has
  changed, and it will very likely not 'drop in', but PHP 5.2.x is not
  supported by php.net any longer, so there wasn't a lot of choice
  in the matter.  We're not able to support a security fork of
  PHP 5.2.x here either, so you'll have to just bite the bullet on
  this.  You'll be better off in the long run.  :)

patches/packages/proftpd-1.3.3d-i486-1_slack13.0.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an unbounded copy operation in sql_prepare_where() that
  could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  However, this only affects
  servers that use the sql_mod module (which Slackware does not ship), and
  in addition the ability to exploit this depends on an SQL injection bug
  that was already fixed in proftpd-1.3.2rc2 (this according to upstream).
  So in theory, this fix should only be of academic interest.
  But in practice, better safe than sorry.

  With Thunderbird 2.x unmaintained, it seems like a good idea to provide a
  upgrade to Thunderbird 3.x for security reasons.  This will bring with it
  quite a bit of changed functionality, so be prepared...  one hint is that
  it will now make local copies of remote mailboxes by default, so you will
  need to have enough disk space to handle that.

  As of version 2.0, SeaMonkey no longer includes a shared libgtkmozembed
  library, so the pkgconfig and header files for this have been removed from
  the package to avoid confusion over why trying to compile programs that
  use it no longer works.  There's not really any way to avoid this issue --
  it's either upgrade SeaMonkey and lose libgtkmozembed, or keep using version
  1.1.18 and miss out on SeaMonkey security updates.  If you really need
  libgtkmozembed, the seamonkey-1.1.18 packages will be retained in either
  /patches or /pasture for Slackware versions 13.0 and earlier.

    Bump patchlevel.
  Thanks to Gary Carvell.
Added 2.6.30.5 generic Linux kernel packages in /testing.  Release time
is getting close, so we're sticking with the 2.6.29.6 kernels as the main
kernels for Slackware 13.0.  Besides, we know of at least one tricky issue
with 2.6.30.x and the LILO bootloader, and the workaround that we know of
likely isn't going to work on BIOSes older than 2001.  Be sure to read the
README_FIRST.TXT (really!) in the directory with the kernel packages if you
intend to try these.

xap/pidgin-2.5.9-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a bug in Pidgin's MSN protocol implementation can allow
  a remote attacker to send a malicious MSN message to a Pidgin user, which
  will possibly cause arbitrary code to be executed as that user.
  This issue was discovered by Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.coresecurity.com/content/libpurple-arbitrary-write
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2694
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 18 18:50:46 CDT 2009
  Patched kernels and kernel packages for Linux 2.6.29.6 to address
  a bug in proto_ops structures which could allow a user to use the
  kernel sendpage operation to execute arbitrary code in page zero.
  This could allow local users to gain escalated privileges.
  This flaw was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the
  Google Security Team.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2692
  In addition, these kernels change the CONFIG_SECURITY_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
  kernel config option value to 4096, which should prevent the execution
  of arbitrary code by future NULL dereference bugs that might be found
  in the kernel.  If you are compiling your own kernel, please check this
  option in your .config.  If it is set to =0, you may wish to edit it
  to 4096 (or some other value > 0) and then reconfigure, or the kernel
  will not have default protection against zero page attacks from
  userspace.

  wasn't a good time to upgrade xfig (3.2.4 also required many patches to

Hi folks!  We're going to call this set of updates RC2.  There are still
README files to be handled (that's the nature of documentation, I guess), as
well as some other things remaining on the TODO list, but X seems pretty
stable now, and it seems like a release soon would be in order so that we
can march right back into development territory with -current again soon.  :-)
Enjoy, and let us know about any problems you run into!

  Change config files in /etc/modprobe.d/ to use a .conf suffix in preparation
  for newer versions of module-init-tools.
  Let the psmouse module load with the default kernel configuration, rather

  This causes problems with firefox-3.5, and too many people are going to
  be confused by that if libsafe remains in /extra.  Really, there's very
  little reason to be running libsafe on a machine that isn't a server
  anyway.  In any case, libsafe has always caused a few programs to fail
  for as long as I can remember.  I'm not sure how much good it still does
  either, considering it's been unmaintained upstream since 2001.
  Feel free to continue using it if you like, but realize that it has the
  potential to break things, especially on desktop machines.

Hi folks -- the TODO isn't entirely empty here, but it's pretty much down
to minor nits, and so we're going to call this release candidate #1 and
(mostly) freeze further updates unless they happen to fix problems.
Regarding the kernel, 2.6.29.x has been well tested with this userspace
and seems like the best choice to ship for production use.  Perhaps we
can put something else (at least source and configs) in /testing, though.
a/slocate-3.1-i486-2.txz:  Rebuilt.  Don't index cifs or tmpfs.
  Add a few more directories to the list of paths to prune.

  o CVE-2009-1886:
    In Samba 3.2.0 to 3.2.12 (inclusive), the smbclient commands dealing

x/mesa-7.4.1-i486-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, actually more like "switched", or "reverted".  After many hours
  trying to track down the reason for reported instability with X and
  compositing (such as crashes when adjusting advanced desktop settings in
  KDE), we've found that it seems to happen only with MesaLib 7.4.2.  Rather
  than trying to cherry-pick changes between 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, we've switched
  to shipping 7.4.1 in the main tree, and have not run into any such problems
  since making the switch.  If people want to continue testing 7.4.2, we've
  moved it into /testing.  Let us know if you run into any problems with
  7.4.1 that are fixed with 7.4.2, and we'll take a look at individual diffs.
extra/kde3-compat/k3b3-1.0.5-i486-opt1.txz:  Added.
  In case the KDE4 version of k3b is not stable, this KDE3 version may be

This batch of updates includes a major overhaul of X.Org -- thanks to Robby
Workman for doing a huge amount of work updating the build scripts and testing
everything.  A large number of packages were recompiled or upgraded to drop
references to the now-obsolete libxcb-xlib and libXaw8 libraries.  We have
workarounds in place for old binaries so it wasn't strictly required, but
recompiling anyway gives a cleaner system.  Enjoy!

  restore foomatic-rip-hplip, as some printers still don't work using the
  regular foomatic-rip filter.  This might require your PPDs to be regenerated
  by removing the printer and reinstalling it.  Thanks to Robby Workman.

Fri May  8 18:49:03 CDT 2009
  Hello folks!  This batch of updates includes the newly released KDE 4.2.3,
  but more noticeably it marks the first departure from the use of gzip for
  compressing Slackware packages.  Instead, we will be using xz, based on
  the LZMA compression algorithm.  xz offers better compression than even
  bzip2, but still offers good extraction performance (about 3 times better
  than bzip2 and not much slower than gzip in our testing).  Since support
  for bzip2 has long been requested, support for bzip2 and the original lzma
  format has also been added (why not?), but this is purely in the interest
  of completeness -- we think most people will probably want to use either
  the original .tgz or the new .txz compression wrappers.  The actual
  Slackware package format (which consists of the layout within the package
  envelope) has not changed, but this is the first support within Slackware's
  package tools for using alternate compression algorithms.
      Some people have asked why we don't pick a single extension, such as
  .slk.  While there's certainly a case to be made for that idea, the tools
  would still need to support .tgz to handle older packages.  Sticking with
  ".tgz" for everything makes no sense.  Using extensions that reflect the
  compression format used by the package envelope seems to be the most
  transparent approach, and the one that best follows tradition.
      As an example of the compression improvement with .txz, have a look
  at the kernel-source package:
  Before:  kernel-source-2.6.29.2_smp-noarch-1.tgz (73808508 bytes)
  After:   kernel-source-2.6.29.2_smp-noarch-1.txz (49150104 bytes)
  The size of the main package tree in /slackware has been reduced from
  1.9GB to 1.4GB by converting most packages to .txz.
      Most of the packages have been converted from .tgz to .txz, but we
  will continue to make the gzip, pkgtools, slackpkg, tar, and xz packages
  in .tgz format for the foreseeable future.
      Enjoy!  And thanks to Lasse Collin for the great work on xz.  :-)

  (* Security fix *)
a/dialog-1.1_20080819-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to make the minimum height of
  checkboxes and menuboxes 4.  This fixes a bug where installer menus were
  taller than they needed to be, and in some cases filled the screen
  overwriting the information at the top.
a/pkgtools-12.34567890-noarch-4.tgz:  Patched to fix failures when a valid
  package extension (.tgz, .tbz, .tlz, .txz) is embedded somewhere in the
  directory path, or the package's name, version, or build number.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-29.tgz:  Patched rc.M to remove files of the form
  {a,}quota.{group,user}.new from the top of filesystems that use quota.  These
  can be created if quota is interrupted by a reboot or power failure and cause
  quotacheck at boot time to fail.  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp.
d/strace-4.5.18-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to strace-4.5.18.
n/bitchx-1.1-i486-5.tgz:  Removed.
  BitchX has several known security flaws for which there are no known
  workarounds, and upstream progress seems to have stalled.  Users should
  switch to a supported IRC client such as irssi.
  (* Security fix *)
n/metamail-2.7-i486-3.tgz:  Updated patch and recompiled.

  modules.  Thanks to Piter Punk and Eric Hameleers.
  When formatting an ext3 partition, don't use '-j' (using mkfs.ext3 already
  takes care of that).
  Use the patched dialog to fix the formatting of the installer menus.
testing/packages/bash-4.0.017-i486-1.tgz:  Updated with upstream patches.
usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Same fixes as initrd.img.

  (* Security fix *)
l/pilot-link-0.12.3-i486-7.tgz:  The dialout devices now use group 'dialout'
  rather than group 'uucp', and the udev rules have been changed to use
  MODE="660" instead of MODE="664".  Thanks to Robby Workman.
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 15 22:17:31 CDT 2009
a/pkgtools-12.34567890-noarch-2.tgz:  Fixed bugs with package extension
  stripping and package description handling that could cause error messages
  or hangs during package installs or upgrades.  Thanks to Piter Punk,
  Alan Hicks, Eric Hameleers, and Robby Workman.

ChangeLog bugs in the last update:
  eigen was removed, not moved from /testing.  This was intentional, as we
  are not aware of anything that has not moved to using eigen2 now.
  k3b was upgraded to k3b-r936571 in kde/, but does not seem to be stable.
  The installers were updated and now support ext4.

d/gcc-4.3.3-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with --enable-libssp.  Removing that was

  use the FT_Get_PS_Font_Info function will need to be recompiled.

x/xdg-utils-1.0.2-noarch-3.tgz:
  This update fixes two security issues.  First, use of xdg-open in
  /etc/mailcap was found to be unsafe -- xdg-open passes along downloaded files
  without indicating what mime type they initially presented themselves as,
  leaving programs further down the processing chain to discover the file type
  again.  This makes it rather trivial to present a script (such as a .desktop
  file) as a document type (like a PDF) so that it looks safe to click on in a
  browser, but will result in the execution of an arbitrary script.  It might
  be safe to send files to trusted applications in /etc/mailcap, but it does
  not seem to be safe to send files to xdg-open in /etc/mailcap.
    This package will comment out calls to xdg-open in /etc/mailcap if they are
  determined to have been added by a previous version of this package.
  If you've made any local customizations to /etc/mailcap, be sure to check
  that there are no uncommented calls to xdg-open after installing this update.
  Thanks to Manuel Reimer for discovering this issue.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0068
  Another bug in xdg-open fails to sanitize input properly allowing the
  execution of arbitrary commands.  This was fixed in the xdg-utils repository
  quite some time ago (prior to the inclusion of xdg-utils in Slackware), but
  was never fixed in the official release of xdg-utils.  The sources for
  xdg-utils in Slackware have now been updated from the repo to fix the problem.

  bluetooth.conf file from bluez-4, this version of bluez can be made to work
  again.  The newer version of the .conf file has been merged into this package,

Upgraded to KDE 4.2rc1 (4.1.96) in /testing.  Thanks very much to Eric Hameleers
for all of the hard work getting this version of KDE ready for /testing so that
Slackware -current will be ready when KDE 4.2 is released!  And thanks for all
of his behind-the-scenes work...  Eric has been following all of the KDE 4.2
betas as well, and taking note as the build requirements have changed.
This set of packages will also work on Slackware 12.2.  If you intend to use
them with Slackware 12.2, grab them now.  Library changes in -current may occur
which could make it more difficult to use these KDE packages with Slackware 12.2
in the future.

n/bind-9.4.3_P1-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.4.3-P1.

a/mkinitrd-1.3.3-i486-1.tgz:
  Fixed a few bugs in the previous mkinitrd package:
  If a kernel version is requested with the -k option and modules are needed to
  build the initrd, exit with an error if no matching /lib/modules/ tree is
  present.  Usually an incorrect kernel version was supplied.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
  When adding kernel modules to the initrd, be more verbose showing success and
  failure copying each module.  Thanks to Ellington Santos.
  With some newer kernels, "/dev/root" might be returned by mount as the root
  device, but this will not work as an initrd root device.  If mount returns
  /dev/root, look at the /dev/root symlink to determine the actual root device
  and use that so that the root device does not need to be supplied with -r.
  In the call to /sbin/modprobe used to determine module dependencies, use the
  option --ignore-install to avoid catching "install" lines under
  /etc/modprobe.d/ when modules that use these are added to the initrd.  This
  prevents /sbin/modprobe from being copied over busybox, breaking the initrd.
  Thanks to Ken Milmore.
xap/mozilla-firefox-3.0.5-i686-1.tgz:

Slackware 12.2 is released as -stable.  Thanks as always to everyone who helped
make this a great point release in the Slackware 12.x series.  Without such a
great community surrounding it, Slackware could not possibly be as stable and
reliable as it is.  Thanks to the Slackware Crew, the users of LinuxQuestions,
people contributing ideas and patches on IRC and other Slackware forums, the
developers at slackbuilds.org for bringing in new technologies, and everyone
else who shared insights that helped to refine this release over many months.
Happy release day to you all!  :-)
  Also, ISOs have been sent off to the replicator now to be pressed as a 6 CD
set or a single DVD.  The store.slackware.com is taking pre-orders -- if you
like Slackware, please consider supporting the project.  We've also added new
black T-shirts with the traditional Slackware logo.  Check them out!
  Once again, thanks to the entire Slackware community for all the help and
encouragement as Slackware 12.2 progressed to release.  Have fun!  -P.

x/xf86-video-intel-2.4.3-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to fix BIOS parsing code and fix
  some Intel and i830 video chipsets.
kernels/speakup.s/:  Fixed missing filesystem drivers.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Added missing mount.nfs.
  Added INSSMB, an installer script to use a Samba source.

n/php-5.2.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.8.
  This is a bugfix release that reverts a change that broke magic_quotes_gpc.
+--------------------------+
Sun Dec  7 23:14:42 CST 2008
n/network-scripts-12.2-noarch-4.tgz:  Patched rc.inet1 to filter output from
  "modprobe -c" that begins with #, preventing spurious error messages.
  Thanks to Darrell Anderson.
+--------------------------+
Sun Dec  7 20:51:39 CST 2008
kde/kdeadmin-3.5.10-i486-4.tgz:  Updated the knetworkconf patch to handle the
  domain name better, and to retain the correct permissions on rc.samba.
  Thanks to Niels Horn for the improvements.
l/dbus-1.2.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dbus-1.2.6.
l/dbus-glib-0.78-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dbus-glib-0.78.
l/hal-0.5.11-i486-3.tgz:  Modified hal.conf to use the plugdev group correctly.
l/libgphoto2-2.4.3-i486-3.tgz:  Added README.jl2005a.  Although the driver
  for this proprietary chipset is not built by default, the README is
  useful to let people know why that is (and perhaps as a warning to steer
  clear of these cameras unless you happen to be an expert in reverse
  engineering compression formats).

a/hdparm-9.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hdparm-9.3.
ap/man-pages-3.15-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to man-pages-3.15.
kde/kdeadmin-3.5.10-i486-3.tgz:  Patched knetworkconf (KDE Control Center
  Network Settings) to be able to configure network interfaces.  Previously,
  knetworkconf would say that the system was not supported and refuse to work
  since it considered only up to Slackware 10.2 supported.  By simply adding
  Slackware 11.0, 12.0, 12.1, and 12.2 to the supported version list, this
  utility works again.  However, it can strip commented out options from the
  rc.inet1.conf config file, and can put options into the file in a confusing
  order, so it is still not the optimal way to configure a network.  Still, 
  it's better to have this working.  Thanks to Niels Horn for writing the
  patch, and Darrell Anderson for letting me know about it.
l/libgphoto2-2.4.3-i486-2.tgz:  Restore README files for camera libraries that
  were not previously included.  A pointer to the API documentation has also
  been added to the docs directory.  Thanks to Theodore Kilgore for pointing
  out the usefulness of these documentation files to end users.
n/network-scripts-12.2-noarch-3.tgz:  Allow rc.inet1.conf to override MAXNICS
  value in rc.inet1.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
  Added rc.inet1.8 and rc.inet1.conf.5 manpages.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
  Removed duplicated code in rc.inet1 default case.  Thanks to Collin Baillie.
xap/pidgin-2.5.2-i486-3.tgz:  Patched to accept certificates signed with
  rsa-md5.  Other SSL libraries accept this, so GnuTLS should as well.
extra/wicd/wicd-1.5.6-noarch-2.tgz:  Change usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/55wicd to
  chmod 644 by default to avoid interference with suspend.
+--------------------------+
Fri Dec  5 20:58:39 CST 2008
ap/ghostscript-8.63-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to remove a dependency on the
  experimental cairo output driver, which brings in dependencies on many X
  libraries.  Thanks to Marin Glibic for the bug report and link to the
  upstream patch.
ap/gutenprint-5.2.2-i486-3.tgz:  Edited setup.06.gutenprint, which still
  had the old path to the PPD files.  Thanks to Markus Kanet.
ap/pm-utils-1.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pm-utils-1.2.3.
xap/gftp-2.0.19-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gftp-2.0.19.

  Runtime Environment Version 6.0 update 11.
n/php-5.2.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.7.
  In addition to improvements and bug fixes, this new version of PHP also
  addresses several security issues, including:
  Fixed a crash inside gd with invalid fonts (Fixes CVE-2008-3658).
  Fixed a possible overflow inside memnstr (Fixes CVE-2008-3659).
  Fixed security issues detailed in CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666.
  Crash with URI/file..php (filename contains 2 dots).  (Fixes CVE-2008-3660).
  rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow. (Fixes CVE-2008-2829).
  Fixed extraction of zip files or directories when the entry name is a

While there are still some docs that need updating and probably a few more
tweaks and updates here and there, everything is mostly in place for the next
stable release, Slackware 12.2.  The versions of major components like X and
the kernel can be considered frozen.  Anything major that we haven't done yet
will probably wait for the release after this next one.  As Slackware 12.2 is
only a 0.1 version bump, we're trying to focus on making it better without
causing instability or losing compatibility with Slackware 12.1 wherever
possible.  Invasive changes like the new X (that will require changes to
xorg.conf) and merging KDE4 should probably wait for Slackware 13.0.
We will call this batch Slackware 12.2 release candidate one.  :-)
a/aaa_base-12.2.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Bumped /etc/slackware-version version number
  in preparation for a stable release, and updated the initial emails.
a/aaa_elflibs-12.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Updated the initial "starter" library package
  to the latest versions in -current.
a/genpower-1.0.5-i486-2.tgz:  Patched genpowerfail to halt the machine during a
  power failure rather than causing it to reboot over and over.
  Thanks to Marin Mitov for the bug report.
a/ntfs-3g-1.5130-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ntfs-3g-1.5130.
a/pciutils-2.2.10-i486-2.tgz:  Updated pci.ids.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-26.tgz:  Patched rc.M to start rc.wicd and 
  rc.snmpd if those scripts are executable, and removed the reference to the
  old rc.hplip script.  Also, modifed rc.K to shut down acpid using rc.acpid.
  Changed /proc/bus/usb mounting in rc.S to use the options from /etc/fstab if
  there is an entry for it there (thanks to Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi).
a/udev-135-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-135.
a/usbutils-0.73-i486-3.tgz:  Updated usb.ids.
ap/alsa-utils-1.0.17-i486-2.tgz:  Patched rc.alsa to use [[:blank:]] instead of
  [[:space:]] with tr, since the latter removes vertical whitespace and causes
  everything to be incorrectly listed on one line.
  Thanks to Ondrej Kubecka for the patch.
l/hal-info-20081127-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hal-info-20081127.
n/ethtool-6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ethtool-6.  Evidently this has been out
  for some time -- thanks to Jan Rafaj for the notice.
n/network-scripts-12.2-noarch-1.tgz:  Removed the automatic DHCP timeout
  reduction in rc.inet1, since the kernel is not reliably returning correct
  information about that.  If the default 30 second timeout is too long, it
  can be shortened in rc.inet1.conf.
  Patched rc.ip_forward to reapply any non-default ipv4 parameters after
  turning ipv4 forwarding on or off, as doing that clears them.  Thanks to Mark.
tcl/expect-5.44.1.11-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
tcl/tcl-8.5.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tcl-8.5.5.

+--------------------------+
Sun Nov 30 22:15:32 CST 2008
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-25.tgz:  Edited rc.S to clear temporary files
  better.  Edited rc.M, rc.6, and rc.K to not output additional information
  when running accton, as the new binary already does that.
a/udev-134-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-134.  Thanks to Piter Punk.
  (Remove any obsolete /etc/modprobe.d/uhci-hci config file after upgrade)
ap/gutenprint-5.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gutenprint-5.2.2.

  video flags after a resume.

ap/vbetool-1.1-i486-1.tgz:  Added vbetool-1.1.
l/jre-6u10-i586-2.tgz:  Added /usr/bin/java/jre/bin directory since the profile
  scripts add it to the $PATH.  Thanks to Phillip Warner.
n/wireless-tools-29-i486-4.tgz:  Patched rc.wireless to take the interface
  down and retry if setting the mode fails.  Thanks to Guan Xin.
+--------------------------+
Sat Nov 29 14:21:53 CST 2008
a/lilo-22.8-i486-14.tgz:  Fixed typo in liloconfig.
a/udev-130-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt including a new /etc/modprobe.d/uhci-hci to
  make sure that the ehci-hcd module is always loaded before uhci-hci.
ap/lsscsi-0.21-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lsscsi-0.21.
  Thanks to Darrell Anderson for pointing me to the new URL.
ap/mc-4.6.1_20070623p14-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to fix a bug where moving or
  copying a file could cause mc to crash.  Thanks to David Somero for the patch.
d/ruby-1.8.7_p72-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with a patch to fix short name
  constants.  Thanks to Marco Bonetti for pointing out the problem.
n/bridge-utils-1.2-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to fix a corner case where brctl does
  not work if the name of the bridge is "bridge".
xap/audacious-plugins-1.5.1-i486-4.tgz:  Patched to fix amidi-plug plugin.

  main tree was long overdue.  Thanks to Piter Punk!  :-)
ap/texinfo-4.13a-i486-2.tgz:  Patched the install script to replace
  /usr/info/dir if the topmost node is missing.
d/kernel-headers-2.6.27.7_smp-x86-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.27.7 headers.
e/emacs-22.3-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt with compressed info pages and using the

a/acpid-1.0.8-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed a bug in the build script so that
  /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh.new is chmoded executable.  If you installed the
  previous package, you should chmod 755 your /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh.
  Thanks to Stuart Winter for pointing this out.
+--------------------------+
Wed Nov 19 19:52:15 CST 2008
a/acpid-1.0.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to acpid-1.0.8.
  /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh will be installed as a .new with future upgrades,
  but since whatever version already installed on the system owns
  /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh, it will still be overwritten one more time when
  this update is installed.  If you've customized your script, be sure to back
  it up before upgrading.
a/mkinitrd-1.3.2-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed a bug where unless -F was the first option
  given, other command line options would not override the contents of
  /etc/mkinitrd.conf as documented in the man page.
  Thanks to David Somero for the patch.
l/libxml2-2.6.32-i486-2.tgz:  Patched and recompiled.
  This fixes vulnerabilities including denial of service, or possibly the
  execution of arbitrary code as the user running a libxml2 linked application
  if untrusted XML content is parsed.

NOTE:  These are some of the more important updates for X.Org.  For the last
  several days we have been building and testing the very newest X updates, and
  it seems that the more intrusive updates are probably best left to develop
  until sometime after the coming -stable Slackware 12.2 release.  Those will
  require a lot of testing and some things don't seem to be quite there yet.
  "X -configure" is hanging the console, DRI is not yet working on all the
  hardware tested, and the new xorg-server will render most existing xorg.conf
  files non-functional until several changes are made.

  one self-signed certificate.  This update fixes the issue.
n/net-snmp-5.4.2.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to net-snmp-5.4.2.1.
  This fixes a problem where a user with read access could cause snmpd to

  letting me know this needed an update and where to find it.
ap/madplay-0.15.2b-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.  This fixes a problem (endian
  issue?) where madplay just outputs noise.
  Thanks to Jan Rafaj for the bug report.
kde/kdepim-3.5.10-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against bluez-libs and pilot-link.

n/bluez-hcidump-1.42-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against bluez-libs-3.36.
n/bluez-libs-3.36-i486-2.tgz:  Switched back to the BlueZ 3.x series.  As the
  website says, "without support from the userspace these modules are useless."
  Well, it seems as if the userspace support for BlueZ 3.x is still much better
  than the support for 4.x, so we'll move back to these packages (recompiled)
  until the situation changes.  Thanks to Tom Nardi for the detailed report
  concerning the usability of BlueZ 3.x versus BlueZ 4.x.
n/bluez-utils-3.36-i486-4.tgz:  Switched back to bluez-utils-3.36, with the
  udev rules moved into /lib/udev/rules.d/.

  From the gnutls-2.6.1 NEWS file:
    ** libgnutls: Fix X.509 certificate chain validation error.
    [GNUTLS-SA-2008-3]  The flaw makes it possible for man in the middle
    attackers (i.e., active attackers) to assume any name and trick GNU TLS

a/cups-1.3.9-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.3.9.
  This update fixes three vulnerabilities in the SGI image format filter, the
  texttops filter, and the HP-GL and HP-GL/2 plotter format filter.  All three
  of these could result in a denial of service, and the plotter filter issue
  could possibly be used to execute code as the print spooler user.

  Note that some drives that were previously seen as /dev/hd? might now show up
  as /dev/sd?, so be prepared for that possibility.  This should only happen on
  machines that could have used libata with hd?=noprobe, but did not.  The
  CONFIG_PATA_LEGACY (libata, /dev/sd?) is the default now for PATA controllers
  that require a generic driver.

  See the documention for changes to the command-line options.
  Thanks to tasos and misiu for the update suggestion.

  Thanks to Patryk Krawaczynski, Keith Richie, and Catalin Tomozei for all
  sending in the same working patch.  Honorable mentions to LukenShiro, misiu,
  and Willy Sudiarto Raharjo for proposing "XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 xmms" as
  another possible workaround for the problem.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep 11 16:02:24 CDT 2008
xap/xmms-1.2.11-i486-1.tgz:  Added xmms-1.2.11.  This is an audio player that
  is similar to audacious, but uses about a third of the CPU power.
  Please note that "doublesize" mode seems broken -- if it is enabled, XMMS
  will crash, and then will not start again until $HOME/.xmms is cleared out.
  Any patch for this issue would be appreciated.

  A few updates...  more to come.
a/glibc-solibs-2.7-i486-11.tgz:  Recompiled against Linux 2.6.24.7.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.7-noarch-11.tgz:  Rebuild from tzcode/tzdata2008e.
a/kernel-generic-2.6.24.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.24.7.
  We are bumping the kernel within the 2.6.24.x series for now rather than
  leaping for 2.6.26.x immediately for sereral reasons.  First, we know that
  it works within the existing framework, and the config files did not need
  major changes (only CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES was changed to =y for
  libcap support).  Also, we know that the kernel headers are usable for
  compiling glibc, KDE, and several other important packages.  Finally, we
  had to recompile the kernel anyway due to the GCC bump, and would rather not
  rush into 2.6.26.x.  Finding the optimal .config files will not be trivial,
  speakup will need to be reevaluated, and so forth.  But don't panic -- the
  goal is 2.6.26.x (or newer, if it proves stable).  Testing here and
  throughout the Slackware community continues with the latest kernels, and so
  far things are looking good.  This is an interim kernel to make sure that
  video drivers, console UTF8, and other things don't suddenly begin to act
  strangely...
a/kernel-generic-smp-2.6.24.7_smp-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux 2.6.24.7.

  Patched to improve UTF8 support (thanks to Vit Rosin).

d/cvs-1.11.23-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cvs-1.11.23.
d/doxygen-1.5.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to doxygen-1.5.6.
d/gcc-4.2.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-4.2.4.
  This an upgrade to a known stable GCC.  The gcc-4.3.x branch is much more
  strict about source correctness, and many upstream sources would need to be
  patched in order to compile with it.  Therefore, this is the logical next
  compiler to use until those issues are worked out upstream.  Adding gcc-4.3.x
  at this time would be, IMHO, an annoyance for many people compiling their own
  sources or packages.
d/gcc-g++-4.2.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gcc-4.2.4.

Tue Sep  2 02:11:27 CDT 2008
n/samba-3.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.2.3.  This fixes a security
  issue where group_mapping.ldb was accidentally chmod 666 (only in -current,
  as all previous Slackware versions use the Samba 3.0.x branch which is not
  affected).  This build also adds the mount.smbfs wrapper script for
  mount.cifs, and a link to the wrapper from /usr/bin/smbmount.  This may
  fix some of the issues that people were having mounting SMB filesystems.
  Note that SMBFS is considered obsolete now, and using mount.smbfs really
  isn't any different in function using the wrapper than using mount.cifs
  directly.  For more information on the security issue, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3789
  (* Security fix *)
  Since this security issue only affects the unreleased development branch,
  (aka -current) this ChangeLog comment is the official notification.
  For those using older versions of Slackware, many of them got bugfix
  updates to the 3.0.x branch.  Check the new packages out -- they should
  correct some stability issues.

kde/koffice-1.6.3-i486-6.tgz:  Patched KOffice to write ODT elements in the

  Venturi while moving ODT documents between OOo and KWord.  Thanks to
  Giovanni Venturi for pointing out the patch in KOffice's SVN.
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug 27 21:01:25 CDT 2008
A couple of things slipped through the cracks with that last update.  An old
patch was applied to kdenetwork making that build fail.  Once that was fixed
kdetoys (previously missing) built correctly.  Perhaps it needed a header file
or library from kdenetwork.  Sorry about that, and thanks to
Willy Sudiarto Raharjo and Corrado Franco for pointing out the omissions.

Upgraded KDE version 3.x.x to 3.5.10.  Really, there's nothing wrong with
looking back as long as it's something stable and dependable.  It's good to
see that KDE3 received this maintainance update.  Thanks, KDE team!  :-)

  Thanks to Robby Workman and Heinz Wiesinger for all the packaging and testing
  help, and of course to the whole KDE community for helping to bring the Linux
  desktop to a whole new level of appearance and ease of use.  I've installed
  this on my main email/browsing/general machine and as far as I'm concerned
  there's just no looking back.  It's really a big step forward.

  this time (it seems that errors are sent to stdout).  Thanks to Robby Workman.
  If we must update icon-cache files in rc.M (which is done only if they already
  exist), background it so that it doesn't delay the boot as much.
  In rc.S, only update the kernel version in /etc/motd if the file begins with
  "Linux", leaving the rest of the file free to be customized.
  Thanks to Pete Cervasio for the improved MOTD script.
  Grab some information about the root partition from /proc/mounts to
  initialize /etc/mtab.  Thanks to Alan Hicks.

Tue Jul 29 13:22:03 CDT 2008
n/proftpd-1.3.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against new OpenSSL, since this
  evidently checks the OpenSSL version and will only run against the
  libraries it was compiled against.  A small patch was also added to
  account for changes in the system includes.
  Thanks to Martin Schmitz for the info and a pointer to the patch.

  This fixes a minor security bug where a very long hostname in the trace path
  could lead to an overflow (and most likely just a crash).
  (* Security fix *)
n/net-snmp-5.4.1.2-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to net-snmp-5.4.1.2.
  A vulnerability was discovered where an attacked could spoof an authenticated

  This release fixes a security issue in slapd (our package does not ship it.)
n/openssh-5.1p1-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to openssh-5.1p1.
  When upgrading OpenSSH, it is VERY IMPORTANT to also upgrade OpenSSL, or
  it is possible to be unable to log back into sshd!
n/openssl-0.9.8h-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to OpenSSL 0.9.8h.
  The Codenomicon TLS test suite uncovered security bugs in OpenSSL.
  If OpenSSL was compiled using non-default options (Slackware's package
  is not), then a malicious packet could cause a crash.  Also, a malformed
  TLS handshake could also lead to a crash.

n/dnsmasq-2.45-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to dnsmasq-2.45.
  It was discovered that earlier versions of dnsmasq have DNS cache
  weaknesses that are similar to the ones recently discovered in BIND.
  This new release minimizes the risk of cache poisoning.
  For more information, see:

  (* Security fix *)
testing/packages/jdk-6u10_beta-i586-1.tgz:  Added Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard
  Edition Runtime Environment Version 6.0 update 10 beta.  Evidently the
  version 6.0 update 7 (stable) packages did not fix the CUPS printing issue,
  but these beta packages should (but remember, they are BETA releases).
testing/packages/jre-6u10_beta-i586-1.tgz:  Added Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard
  Edition Development Kit Version 6.0 update 10 beta.
  Both of these Java(TM) packages are suitable for use on Slackware 12.1 and
  probably on earlier releases as well.

  Upgraded to Firefox 3.0.1.
  This fixes some security issues:
  For more information, see:
    http://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox30.html
  Also, thanks to Phillip Warner for providing a configuration fix to allow
  mailto: links to open in Thunderbird (or other mailers).  To use this, you
  may need to copy /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.1/defaults/profile/mimeTypes.rdf over
  your own mimeTypes.rdf under $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/{something}.default,
  or merge in the changes to your own mimeTypes.rdf.

a/ntfs-3g-1.2712-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ntfs-3g-1.2712.
  This has been compiled to use the internal FUSE library rather than the
  system FUSE library.  The benefit of this is that if /bin/ntfs-3g is make
  setuid root, then non-root users can use it to mount NTFS partitions if
  /etc/fstab allows it.  Also, this version of ntfs-3g would require the CVS
  version of external FUSE, so that helped make this an easy choice.
a/util-linux-ng-2.14-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to util-linux-ng-2.14.
x/mesa-7.0.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mesa-7.0.3.
  We've had a few reports that this new mesa version fixes some instability
  issues people were having with mesa-7.0.2.  While it's not usually a good
  idea to run -current packages on older Slackware versions, this mesa package
  should be fully compatible with a patched-up Slackware 12.1 box.  If mesa is
  causing issues for you, it might be worth a try.  At worst you'd have to go
  back to the older package.
    When we make changes to the libraries or toolchain that would make -current
  break compatibility with Slackware 12.1, we will try to make note of it here.
  However, we don't always know what side effects or regressions an update may
  cause, but will do the best we can to offer a heads-up where possible.
xap/seamonkey-1.1.11-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Seamonkey 1.1.11.

n/bind-9.4.2_P1-i486-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.4.2-P1.
  This upgrade addresses a security flaw known as the CERT VU#800113 DNS Cache
  Poisoning Issue.  This is the summary of the problem from the BIND site:
    "A weakness in the DNS protocol may enable the poisoning of caching
     recurive resolvers with spoofed data.  DNSSEC is the only full solution.
     New versions of BIND provide increased resilience to the attack."
  It is suggested that sites that run BIND upgrade to one of the new packages
  in order to reduce their exposure to DNS cache poisoning attacks.

  Edition Runtime Environment Version 6.0 update 10 beta.  This is a BETA
  VERSION and may contain problems, but it may also fix an issue with CUPS
  printing.  If this fix is important to you, it may be worth giving this
  package a try at your own risk.  For now, -current seems like the only prudent
  place for this package.  Hopefully we will see official 6u10 releases soon.

     (reported by iDefense)"
  This package build also includes the new alsa driver (--with-sound=alsa),

Slackware 12.1 is released as -stable.  :-)  Again, huge thanks to everybody
who pitched in and helped with bug reports, patches, testing, suggestions,
other comments, and everything else.  Without this valuable input, Slackware
would be nowhere near what it is today.  Special thanks to the CREW, to the
people developing and testing for slackbuilds.org (where many of Slackware's
future additions are first built and tested), and to everyone on
linuxquestions.org, various #slackware or ##slackware IRC channels, other
Slackware related web sites, and other places where the community shares their
needs and concerns with the team.  On behalf of everyone here, thanks.
  We think you'll enjoy this new release, and hope that you'll find it to be
much more than 0.1 better than Slackware 12.0.  ;-)
Have fun!  -P.
extra/slackpkg/slackpkg-2.70.3-noarch-2.tgz:  Updated the version in the
