patches/packages/bind-9.7.6_P2-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:  Upgraded.
  Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using
  "Bad cache" data before it has been initialized.  [RT #30025]
  ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a
  race condition that could cause a memory leak.  This rarely occurred
  with UDP clients, but could be a significant problem for a server
  handling a steady rate of TCP queries.  [RT #29539 & #30233]
  Under heavy incoming TCP query loads named could experience a
  memory leak which could lead to significant reductions in query
  response or cause the server to be terminated on systems with
  "out of memory" killers. [RT #29539]
  A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length
  RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of
  the named process.  [RT #29644]

patches/packages/bind-9.7.6_P1-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an issue that could crash BIND, leading to a denial of
  service.  It also fixes the so-called "ghost names attack" whereby a
  remote attacker may trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1033
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1667
  IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is a upgraded version of BIND, _not_ a patched one.
  It is likely to be more strict about the correctness of configuration files.
  Care should be taken about deploying this upgrade on production servers to
  avoid an unintended interruption of service.

patches/packages/proftpd-1.3.3d-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an unbounded copy operation in sql_prepare_where() that
  could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  However, this only affects
  servers that use the sql_mod module (which Slackware does not ship), and
  in addition the ability to exploit this depends on an SQL injection bug
  that was already fixed in proftpd-1.3.2rc2 (this according to upstream).
  So in theory, this fix should only be of academic interest.
  But in practice, better safe than sorry.

  Upgraded to bind-9.4.2-P1.
  This upgrade addresses a security flaw known as the CERT VU#800113 DNS Cache
  Poisoning Issue.  This is the summary of the problem from the BIND site:
    "A weakness in the DNS protocol may enable the poisoning of caching
     recurive resolvers with spoofed data.  DNSSEC is the only full solution.
     New versions of BIND provide increased resilience to the attack."
  It is suggested that sites that run BIND upgrade to one of the new packages
  in order to reduce their exposure to DNS cache poisoning attacks.

  This version of PHP contains many fixes and enhancements.  Some of the fixes
  are security related, and the PHP release announcement provides this list:
    * Fixed possible stack buffer overflow in the FastCGI SAPI identified by
      Andrei Nigmatulin.
    * Fixed integer overflow in printf() identified by Maksymilian Aciemowicz.
    * Fixed security issue detailed in CVE-2008-0599 identified by Ryan Permeh.
    * Fixed a safe_mode bypass in cURL identified by Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
    * Properly address incomplete multibyte chars inside escapeshellcmd()
      identified by Stefan Esser.

patches/packages/libpng-1.2.27-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to libpng-1.2.27.
  This fixes various bugs, the most important of which have to do with the
  handling of unknown chunks containing zero-length data.  Processing a PNG
  image that contains these could cause the application using libpng to crash
  (possibly resulting in a denial of service), could potentially expose the
  contents of uninitialized memory, or could cause the execution of arbitrary
  code as the user running libpng (though it would probably be quite difficult
  to cause the execution of attacker-chosen code).  We recommend upgrading the
  package as soon as possible.

  In addition to bugfixes and enhancements, this version of m4 also fixes two
  issues with possible security implications.  A minor security fix with the
  use of "maketemp" and "mkstemp" -- these are now quoted to prevent the
  (rather unlikely) possibility that an unquoted string could match an
  existing macro causing operations to be done on the wrong file.  Also,
  a problem with the '-F' option (introduced with version 1.4) could cause a
  core dump or possibly (with certain file names) the execution of arbitrary
  code.  For more information on these issues, see:

  This update fixes the following security related issues:
     URIs with invalid %-encoding mishandled by Windows (MFSA 2007-36).
     Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (MFSA 2007-29).
   OK, so the first one obviously does not affect us.  :-)  The second fix has
   to do with the same JavaScript handling problem fixed before in Firefox.
   JavaScript is not enabled by default in Thunderbird, and the developers
   (at least in MFSA 2007-36) do not recommend turning it on.

  From the OpenSSH release notes:
  "Security bugs resolved in this release:  Prevent ssh(1) from using a
  trusted X11 cookie if creation of an untrusted cookie fails; found and
  fixed by Jan Pechanec."
  While it's fair to say that we here at Slackware don't see how this could
  be leveraged to compromise a system, a) the OpenSSH people (who presumably
  understand the code better) characterize this as a security bug, b) it has
  been assigned a CVE entry, and c) OpenSSH is one of the most commonly used
  network daemons.  Better safe than sorry.

  about that, folks.  The JRE package was not affected.
  BTW, any time a security upgrade package mentioned in an advisory is
  "missing", it probably means a mistake like this was made.  In those
  cases, look for a newer package, and verify the authenticity using
  "gpg --verify" and the .asc file.

patches/packages/jre-6u2-i586-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard Edition Runtime Environment
  Version 6.0 update 2.
  This update addresses code errors which could possibly be leveraged to
  compromise system security, though we know of no existing exploits.
  This update consists of the official Java(TM) binaries repackaged in
  Slackware's package format, and may be used on any version of Slackware
  that is based on glibc.
  For more information, see:
    http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102995-1
  (* Security fix *)
  An additional change was made to the script that Slackware uses to
  set environment variables for Java(TM).  Now, after the $JAVA_HOME
  variable is set, the next variable settings make use of it, rather
  than hard-coding the path to $JAVA_HOME.  This does not fix a bug,
  but is certainly better scripting style.  Thanks to Jason Byrne and
  Jean-Christophe Fargette for suggesting this change.

patches/packages/bind-9.4.1_P1-i486-1_slack12.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.4.1_P1 to fix security issues.
  The default access control lists allow remote attackers to make recursive
  queries in BIND9 versions 9.4.0 through 9.4.1.
  The query IDs in BIND9 prior to BIND 9.4.1-P1 are cryptographically weak.

patches/packages/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.5-i686-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to thunderbird-2.0.0.5.  Since Thunderbird shares the browser engine
  with Firefox it is susceptible to similar vulnerabilities.  This update fixes
  the same issues fixed in the recent Firefox patch.

patches/packages/seamonkey-1.1.3-i486-1_slack12.tgz:
  Upgraded to seamonkey-1.1.3.  This is presumably a security update, but the
  details on the net have been sparse.  So far nothing has appeared at the
  usual URL, but I would treat this as a security update unless it is announced
  as otherwise.

patches/packages/mkinitrd-1.1.3-i486-1.tgz:  Fixed a minor bug in mkinitrd
  where devices such as /dev/cciss/c0d0p2 (DL360 RAID) were not properly copied
  to the initramfs.  "Normal" (two level) boot devices such as /dev/sda1 were
  not affected by this bug, so most people won't run into it (which is probably
  why it wasn't spotted in development here).
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for the patch.
patches/packages/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.5-i686-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to firefox-2.0.0.5.
  This upgrade fixes a couple of minor security bugs.  Nobody here is launching
  Firefox from Internet Explorer, right?  :-)

Sun Jul  1 22:30:42 CDT 2007
Released as Slackware 12.0 with no changes since the last batch.
  Big Thanks again are due to the CREW, without whom this just wouldn't be
  possible to do with the level of quality that Slackware users demand.
  We had a lot of help this time, and I hope it shows in project output
  that you'll enjoy.  Thanks for the support of the Slackware community,
  because without your support I wouldn't be able to keep leading this
  project (and I happen to like it a lot :-).
  For more detailed information about what all has changed since Slackware
  11.0, start with CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT, and maybe read my RELEASE_NOTES.
  Have fun!
+--------------------------+
Sun Jul  1 18:20:45 CDT 2007
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-6.tgz:  Fixed a minor bug in the install script where
  it would try to back up website directories without checking that they
  existed.  This was harmless (but did make an ugly error).
n/network-scripts-12.0-noarch-4.tgz:  Removed a silly "sanity check" that
  figured if you didn't have /bin/telnet that you must not have
  networking installed.  ;-)  Thanks to Fredrik for spotting this one.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 30 22:21:33 CDT 2007
x/xinit-1.0.4-i486-2.tgz:  This package should not contain an xinitrc since
  in contains no window manager.  But, since it's probably already installed
  one on any -current running machine, removing it will remove your symlink
  to any existing xinitrc.*.  If that happens, we link to xinitrc.kde.  If
  that is not your window manager of choice -- sorry about that.  A quick
  run of xwmconfig as root will let you get the system wide defaults back
  the way you like them.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 30 21:08:41 CDT 2007
n/network-scripts-12.0-noarch-3.tgz:  It looks like 10 is probably the
  minimum safe automatic DHCP timeout reduction value, as there's been a
  report that a common cable modem can require about 7 seconds to grant
  a lease.  So 10 is about the best we can do for you "out of the box", but
  you can always set a lower timeout if that works.  :-)
  Thanks to Catalin Tomozei for the report.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 30 20:13:46 CDT 2007
isolinux/initrd.img:  Fixed parted-1.8.7 tools (libreadline was still required
  by the "static" binary, so we went all dynamic).  Thanks to arny.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Replaced parted-1.8.7 tools with the fixed ones.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 30 16:06:18 CDT 2007
n/inetd-1.79s-i486-8.tgz:  Fixed a couple /opt/kde/ paths in inetd.conf.
  Thanks to Stas Boukarev for pointing them out.
extra/checkinstall/:  This had to be removed because it does not work with the
  latest coreutils.  There is a readme in this directory with the URL to
  checkinstall's homepage, so if you must use checkinstall poll the site
  periodically to see if a version comes out that fixes this issue.
extra/slacktrack/slacktrack-1.32-i486-1.tgz:  Merged the newest version.  Note
  that this works, but must touch all the files on the system.  This is because
  installwatch.so does not work with the newest coreutils.  However, a new
  version will probably be created soon that does, so check the slacktrack
  page (or here, on ftp sites) for possible full-functionality upgrades.
+--------------------------+
Sat Jun 30 13:56:39 CDT 2007
n/network-scripts-12.0-noarch-2.tgz:  If no explicit DCHP_TIMEOUT is set, then
  look in /sys to see if the interface has a connection carrier.  If not,
  reduce the DHCP timeout to 3 seconds (which, even if the kernel is wrong, is
  usually more than enough time for the DHCP server to respond). 
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for making me add this patch at the 11th hour.  ;-)
+--------------------------+
Fri Jun 29 23:02:49 CDT 2007
d/pkg-config-0.21-i486-6.tgz:  Use a symlink to fix broken packages that think
  /usr/share/pkgconfig is a good place for .pc files.  Move any .pc files found
  to already exist there.
d/mercurial-0.9.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mercurial-0.9.4.
  Thanks to Shridhar for getting this one in under the wire.
extra/xf86-video-ati-6.6.3/xf86-video-ati-6.6.3-i486-3.tgz:
  Some people are getting a black screen with newer driver versions, so here
  is an alternate to try, just in case.
+--------------------------+
Fri Jun 29 00:34:26 CDT 2007
a/udev-111-i486-5.tgz:  Added some more platform rules in 50-udev-rules.
  Thanks to Piter Punk for the new udev rules.
d/git-1.5.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to git-1.5.2.2, fixed .packlist paths, and
  got git-remote working again (Error.pm was previously missing).
  Thanks to Dagmar d'Surreal for the patch.
l/gd-2.0.35-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed 640 perms on docs.
  Thanks to Steven Masta for pointing this out.
n/php-5.2.3-i486-2.tgz:  OK, I think we have a working combination of PHP
  extensions now.  If you notice any problems, let me know soon (along with
  a fix, if possible).  As it stands, everything that could be built as an
  extension is loaded by default, so you may want to do some extension
  pruning in /etc/httpd/php.ini.
kde/kdebase-3.5.7-i486-2.tgz:  Fix the same kind of escaping problem as seen
  below in the xfce fix, also found in /etc/profile.d/kde.csh.
  Thanks to Laurence Darby and Tsomi.
xap/xfce-4.4.1-i486-5.tgz:  In xfce4-mixer, use --with-sound=alsa option to
  make sure that OSS is not used accidentally (probably more of an issue if
  someone rebuilds, I'm told).  Thanks to Tsomi.
  Use ${VAR} instead of $VAR before a : in xfce.csh.  This seems cleaner than
  escaping the : with a \.  Thanks to Laurence Darby again.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jun 28 01:44:43 CDT 2007
a/cxxlibs-6.0.8-i486-4.tgz:  Restored libstdc++-3-libc6.1-2-2.10.0.so, still
  required for some commercial software.  (Yikes!)
a/hdparm-7.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hdparm-7.6.
a/mkinitrd-1.1.2-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed a cosmetic boot-time error if cryptsetup is
  not used in the initramfs.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-13.tgz:  Mount usbfs regardless of whether udev
  is used.  VMware and other things need this.  Thanks to Bren.
  Oh, and BTW -- use udev.  :-)
d/libtool-1.5.24-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libtool-1.5.24.
d/p2c-1.21alpha2-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed build script to optimize properly.
  Thanks to Martijn Dekker for the bug report and fix.
d/rcs-5.7-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed incorrect perms (711) on binaries.
  Thanks to Selkfoster for the report.
l/cairo-1.4.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cairo-1.4.10.
l/hal-0.5.9.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hal-0.5.9.1.
l/hal-info-20070618-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hal-info-20070618.
n/dhcp-3.0.5-i486-2.tgz:  Patched kernel version detection in ./configure,
  which might make dhclient work.  dhcpcd is probably still better though :-)
  Thanks to Dagmar d'Surreal for the patch.
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-5.tgz:  Made the package install script look at the
  contents of /srv and take care not to wipe out any existing website there,
  but to back it up instead.  Sorry if previous packages bit your site...
n/iptables-1.3.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to iptables-1.3.8.
n/tcpdump-3.9.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libpcap-0.9.6 and tcpdump-3.9.6.
n/whois-4.7.21-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to whois-4.7.21.
t/tetex-3.0-i486-5.tgz:  An often-reported bug in the tetex package has been
  the missing /var/lib/texmf directory.  Some time ago, this was removed for
  security reasons, since it could possibly be used to overwrite system files
  by symlinking to them from "font names".  The directory, to be useful, had
  to be world-writable, or at least writable to a tetex group.
  Then, Mikhail Ulanov suggested setting VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR, which
  causes fonts to be built in $HOME/.texmf-var instead.  Now TeX is working
  again for non-root users.  Thanks very much Mikhail!  :-)
t/tetex-doc-3.0-i486-5.tgz:  Rebuilt.
x/libX11-1.1.1-i486-4.tgz:  Patched to fix a bug introduced while converting
  some code from K&R to ANSI C.  This should make gdk+ and GIMP a lot more
  stable.  Thanks to Robby Workman for pointing out the patch on the
  freedesktop.org site.  And thanks to dive from LQ for suggesting we look
  at libX11, too.  :-)
+--------------------------+
Wed Jun 27 01:40:34 CDT 2007
a/pkgtools-12.0.0-noarch-4.tgz:  Fixed htmlview, making it a short script
  rather than a symlink (which doesn't always work).
  Thanks to Sander de Leeuw for the report and fix.
kde/kvpnc-0.8.9-i486-1.tgz:  Removed.  The reports were that this wasn't
  working (though some said that earlier versions never included in
  Slackware did).  So, it's been deemed not quite stable enough for the
  stable release.  We'll look at it again for next time.
l/gd-2.0.35-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gd-2.0.35.
  This fixes a few possible security issues:
     * Possible infinite loop in the PNG reader
     * Possible integer overflow in gdImageCreateTrueColor
     * Possible crash in gdImageCreateXbm
     * Numerous flaws in the GIF reader
  (* Security fix *)
l/gmime-2.2.9-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gmime-2.2.9.
n/pssh-1.3.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Added pssh-1.3.1, python scripts to run openssh
  tools in parallel.  Thanks to Jan Rafaj for the build script.  Normally I
  wouldn't add things in late RC, but for Jan I'll make an exception.  :-)
n/samba-3.0.25b-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.25b.
x/xf86-video-savage-2.1.2-i486-2.tgz:  Committed upstream patch to fix a crash
  of the savage_drv.so driver when respawned.  Thanks to Michael Wagner.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Added parted-1.8.7 tools.
kernels/speakup.s/:  Backed up speakup to CVS 2007-03-03 and recompiled.
  I'm hoping this fixes a DecTalk Express problem.
  Thanks to Stephen C. Greeley for all the help debugging this.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Added parted-1.8.7 tools.
+--------------------------+
Tue Jun 26 01:31:45 CDT 2007
This might as well be called 12.0 RC2 so that we're not accused on skimping on
release candidates.  ;-)  Still going through various reports, and (especially)
looking into getting the php.ini defaults reasonable (as well as figuring out
which features can be safely built as extensions).  But, we're getting there.
a/aaa_elflibs-12.0.0-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed a bad link in the install script.  I
  think the first-boot ldconfig would fix it anyway, but we like things clean
  around here.  Thanks to Robert Boucher for noticing this.
a/pkgtools-12.0.0-noarch-3.tgz:  Added an installer script to make a
  /usr/bin/htmlview symlink if one does not already exist (programs in
  Slackware are starting to expect htmlview, which is not yet a standard but
  seems to be becoming an ad-hoc one...)  So, adding it probably won't hurt
  too much, other than possibly stinging other distributions that haven't yet
  added this by encouraging its use.  Shame on us.  ;-)
  Thanks to Nikos Skalkotos for pointing out that CUPS uses this script,
  alias, symlink -- whatever the local implementation...
a/udev-111-i486-4.tgz:  Make the restart option more through.  Thanks to
  Andrea Zulato for reporting that stop/start was needed to load rule changes,
  and to Piter Punk for fixing rc.udev.
a/util-linux-2.12r-i486-6.tgz:  Patched a problem where umounting by UUID
  would cause umount to segfault for non-root users.  Thanks to Diogo R
  for the pointer to a patch at http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/7211.
  Evidently this has already been reported upstream.
d/binutils-2.17.50.0.17-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to binutils-2.17.50.0.17.
  Thanks to Giacomo Lozito for reporting that this was released and seems to
  be fixing problems with 'ld' segfaulting.
d/oprofile-0.9.2-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled against new (binutils) libbfd.
kde/k3b-1.0.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-1.0.2.
kdei/k3b-i18n-1.0.2-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-i18n-1.0.2.
l/pilot-link-0.12.2-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed a bug in pilot-link.m4.
  Thanks to Michael Stenzel for the bug report and a link to a patch.
xap/xchat-2.8.2-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with official patch.  Thanks to Tsomi.
extra/intel-wlan-ipw3945:  Added a few missing bits and rearranged the tree
  a bit.  Thanks to Gabriel Linder for noticing that the kernel module
  happens to work with the ieee80211 stack already in our kernel.  That makes
  getting this to work quite a bit easier.  :-)
isolinux/initrd.img:  Updated with fixed umount.
pasture/:  Flushed devfsd and ipchains.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated with fixed umount.
usb-and-pxe-installers/etherboot/:  Various fixes and docs improvements.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp.
+--------------------------+
Thu Jun 21 19:37:47 CDT 2007
Still working through the pile, so if you don't see your bug report fixed yet,
it could still be coming.  But, we figured these things should get tested
sooner rather than later.  :-)
a/aaa_elflibs-12.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded expat library.
a/cryptsetup-1.0.5-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed locale directory.
  Thanks to Robby Workman, Greg' Ar Tourter, Cristian Contescu, and Selkfoster.
a/glibc-solibs-2.5-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2.5-noarch-4.tgz:  Rebuilt.
a/gettext-0.16.1-i486-3.tgz:  Rebuilt.
a/kernel-generic-2.6.21.5-i486-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 single processor generic.s (requires initrd) kernel.
a/kernel-generic-smp-2.6.21.5_smp-i686-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 SMP gensmp.s (requires initrd) kernel.
a/kernel-huge-2.6.21.5-i486-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 single processor huge.s (full-featured) kernel.
a/kernel-huge-smp-2.6.21.5_smp-i686-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 SMP hugesmp.s (full-featured) kernel.
a/kernel-modules-2.6.21.5-i486-2.tgz
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 UP single processor kernel modules.
a/kernel-modules-smp-2.6.21.5_smp-i686-2.tgz
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.21.5 SMP kernel modules.
d/kernel-headers-2.6.21.5_smp-i386-2.tgz:
  Rebuilt Linux 2.6.21.5 SMP kernel headers.
a/pkgtools-12.0.0-noarch-2.tgz:  Added rc.snmpd to the services setup menu in
  the installer.
a/shadow-4.0.3-i486-14.tgz:  Added plugdev to the list of groups that a user
  logging in through /bin/login at the console will automatically be added to.
  With a login manager such as kdm, users will still need to be added to
  the plugdev group manually.
ap/vim-7.1.012-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.1.012.
d/gettext-tools-0.16.1-i486-3.tgz:  Added back "archive.tar.gz" which is not
  useless and is required in some cases by the autotools.  If anyone else
  notices any more "useless" stuff being installed by "make install", please
  inquire with the developers of the upstream source before requesting that
  it be removed.  Thanks.  :-)
k/kernel-source-2.6.21.5_smp-noarch-2.tgz
  Rebuilt the Linux 2.6.21.5 SMP kernel source, removing the
  CONFIG_HEADERS_CHECK option.  Thanks to Cardoe in #hal for cluing us in
  that there were some problems with trying to use the headers found in
  /usr/src/linux/usr/include as the userspace headers under /usr/include,
  such as a missing "#define SG_FLAG_LUN_INHIBIT 2" in scsi/sg.h.
kde/amarok-1.4.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to amarok-1.4.6.
l/esound-0.2.38-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to esound-0.2.38.
l/expat-2.0.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to expat-2.0.1.
l/gamin-0.1.8-i486-2.tgz:  Changed options to --disable-dnotify and
  --enable-inotify, which is a superior filesystem tracking method on
  2.6.13+ kernels.  Thanks to Andrey V. Panov.
l/glibc-2.5-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against the correct 2.6.21.5 headers.
l/glibc-i18n-2.5-noarch-4.tgz:  Rebuilt.
l/glibc-profile-2.5-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled.
l/libglade-2.6.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libglade-2.6.1.
l/mhash-0.9.9-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mhash-0.9.9.
n/mcabber-0.9.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mcabber-0.9.3.
n/net-snmp-5.4-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled without the --enable-reentrant which
  was causing snmpd to not work.  Added a more simple, Slackware-like rc.snmpd.
  Thanks to Piter Punk for fixing this.
n/network-scripts-12.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Rebuilt to include the better-commented
  rc.inet1.conf that was added to source/n/network-scripts/ back in May.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for noticing that the package never got a rebuild
  after that change.
xap/pan-0.131-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pan-0.131.
xap/pidgin-2.0.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pidgin-2.0.2.
xap/vim-gvim-7.1.012-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.1.012 for GTK+.
  This also requires the main VIM package...
extra/linux-2.6.21.5-nosmp-sdk/:  Upgraded the kit to transform the Linux
  kernel sources in /usr/src/linux/ from SMP to non-SMP without having to
  recompile them.  NOTE:  it is probably best to use the SMP kernel even in
  a single processor machine if it will run.  The non-SMP kernels should
  really be used only in machines that are not at least a Pentium-Pro, or
  that (for some other reason) will not properly run the SMP kernel.
kernels/hugesmp.s/*:  Recompiled the hugesmp.s 2.6.21.5 SMP kernel.

  Thanks to Michael Wagner for pointing out the uncompressed man pages.
kde/kdelibs-3.5.7-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to call utempter in the proper location

n/bind-9.4.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bind-9.4.1.
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-4.tgz:  Moved the main directory to the usual Slackware
  location of "/var/www", which should ease transitioning existing sites as
  well as prevent /srv from becoming (right away) a bloated top-level
  directory.  In /srv, make two symlinks for FHS compliance:
  /srv/www -> /var/www (this makes htdig with KDE work again), and
  /srv/httpd -> /var/www (/srv/httpd will be the default path used in the
  httpd.conf, and seems to me to be following the spirit behind "/srv").
  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo for pointing out that these paths
  needed some adjustment to fix KDE's help search system (htdig).
  Since the old apache had visible log files (in a 755 mode directory),
  make these visible, too.  If the admin wants to lock them down, we'll
  make sure the chosen mode sticks.  Thanks to Dieter Rauschenberger.
n/lynx-2.8.6rel.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lynx-2.8.6rel.5.  Compiled with
  --with-screen=ncursesw and --enable-widec.  Thanks to Stas Boukarev.

n/mtr-0.72-i486-1.tgz:  Added mtr-0.72.
n/net-snmp-5.4-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed a few uncompressed man pages.
  Thanks to Michael Wagner for pointing out the uncompressed man pages.
n/nmap-4.20-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to nmap-4.20.
n/openssl-0.9.8e-i486-3.tgz:  Added certwatch script.  Thanks to Jan Rafaj.
n/openvpn-2.0.9-i486-1.tgz:  Added openvpn-2.0.9.  Thanks to Alan Hicks.  :-)
n/sendmail-8.14.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.14.1.

x/dejavu-ttf-2.17-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dejavu-ttf-2.17.
x/xkeyboard-config-0.9-noarch-2.tgz:  Make sure /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/pc is
  installed as a file.  If not, back up /etc/X11/xkb to make way for the new
  structure of xkeyboard-config.
  Thanks to Corvin Dun and David Jeannot for the bug reports.
xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to audacious-plugins-1.3.5.
xap/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.4-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to thunderbird-2.0.0.4.
  This upgrade fixes two possible security bugs.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#thunderbird
  (* Security fix *)
xap/pidgin-2.0.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pidgin-2.0.1.
xap/vim-gvim-7.1.002-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to GTK+ vim-7.1.002 add-on.
xap/xfce-4.4.1-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed uncompressed man pages.
  Escaped the ':'s in /etc/profile.d/xfce.csh.  Thanks to Laurence Darby.
xap/xine-lib-1.1.7-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xine-lib-1.1.7.
extra/grub/grub-0.97-i486-3.tgz:  Use C locale for proper fdisk parsing in
  other locales.  Thanks to Seb for the patch.  :-)
extra/intel-wlan-ipw3945:  Added kernel patches and support sources for
  using the Intel ipw3945 wireless drivers.  Due to the need to patch the
  kernel for a newer ieee80211 subsystem, these are all in source form
  rather than as packages.  Consider it an opportunity to learn.  :-)
extra/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.8_2.6.21.5-i486-1.tgz:  Recompiled
  linux-wlan-ng-0.2.8 with modules for Linux 2.6.21.5 (both SMP and non-SMP).
extra/linux-2.6.21.5-nosmp-sdk/:  Upgraded the kit to transform the Linux
  kernel sources in /usr/src/linux/ from SMP to non-SMP without having to
  recompile them.  NOTE:  it is probably best to use the SMP kernel even in
  a single processor machine if it will run.  The non-SMP kernels should
  really be used only in machines that are not at least a Pentium-Pro, or
  that (for some other reason) will not properly run the SMP kernel.
extra/slackpkg/slackpkg-2.61-noarch-2.tgz:  Upgraded to
  slackpkg-2.61-noarch-2.  Thanks to Piter Punk!
isolinux/initrd.img:  Merged Eric Hameleers' LVM installer changes.
  Added cryptsetup.  Updated syslinux.  Added dhcpcd.
  Version number bump.
kernels/huge.s/*:  Upgraded huge.s kernel to 2.6.21.5.
kernels/hugesmp.s/*:  Upgraded hugesmp.s kernel to 2.6.21.5 (SMP).
kernels/speakup.s/*:  Added kernel with Speakup support.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated USB and PXE installers with merged-in
  (semi-DIY) LVM and crypto support.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers!
usb-and-pxe-installers/etherboot/:  Added floppy images to support a PXE
  install with Ethernet cards and/or BIOS that lack hardware PXE support.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp for keeping the floppy disk install alive!

Wed Jun 13 22:14:23 CDT 2007
l/libexif-0.6.16-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libexif-0.6.16.
  An integer overflow in libexif can crash applications that use the library
  on malformed images.  The upstream advisory indicates that this flaw could
  also be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user, but no
  exploit is known (by us) to exist among iDefense's researchers or in the
  wild.  But, as a crash bug and heap overflow one must suppose that the
  possibility exists.

n/php-5.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.3.
  Here's some basic information about the release from php.net:
    "This release continues to improve the security and the stability of the
    5.X branch as well as addressing two regressions introduced by the
    previous 5.2 releases.  These regressions relate to the timeout handling
    over non-blocking SSL connections and the lack of HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA in
    certain conditions.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release."

  doesn't clean up its .pid file.
l/hal-0.5.9-i486-2.tgz:  Cleanups to rc.hald.  Thanks to "ivv mm" for reporting
  the problem with these startup scripts (most obvious if one tries to go to
  runlevel 1 and then back to runlevel 3).

l/svgalib-1.9.25-i486-1.tgz:  This package no longer contains the kernel
  modules required by svgalib, which are now packaged in a separate
  svgalib_helper package.
l/svgalib_helper-1.9.25_2.6.21.3-i486-1.tgz:  Added svgalib_helper containing
  the kernel helper module for svgalib.  Both SMP and non-SMP modules are
  included in the package.
l/qt-3.3.8-i486-4.tgz:  Rebuilt with the sources in /usr/lib/qt/, but using
  DESTDIR to create a finished package in /tmp.  Thanks to Stuart Winter for
  figuring out this trick.  :-)
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed recursion bug in the logrotate config file.
  Fixed incorrect options to rc.httpd  (thanks to mrgoblin).
n/mutt-1.4.2.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mutt-1.4.2.3.
n/php-5.2.2-i486-3.tgz:  Modularized all extensions, and fixed PEAR problems.
  Moved PHP session file to /var/lib/php.  Show an example of how to run all
  .php, .html, and .htm files through PHP by default  (thanks to mrgoblin).
  Thanks to Rodrigo Fuentealba for help on what ./configure options to use.
n/samba-3.0.25a-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.25a.  This fixes some major
  (non-security) bugs in samba-3.0.25 -- see the WHATSNEW.txt for details.
x/x11-skel-7.1-noarch-6.tgz:  Fixed number of lines in slack-desc.
xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed crash on non-SSE2 platforms due
  to use of an SSE2 instruction in the libmadplug.so plugin.  Thanks to
  everyone who reported this, to Giacomo Lozito for the patch, and to Tsomi
  for testing it.  :-)
xap/blackbox-0.65.0-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed the SlackBuild to build bbkeys.
  Thanks to Mikhail Zotov for the bug report and fix.
xap/gimp-2.2.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-2.2.15.
xap/sane-1.0.18-i486-5.tgz:  Moved libsane.rules to 80-libsane.rules.
  Got rid of obsolete hotplug files.
xap/xfce-4.4.1-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled against HAL.
extra/linux-2.6.21.3-nosmp-sdk/:  Upgraded the kit to transform the Linux
  kernel sources in /usr/src/linux/ from SMP to non-SMP without having to
  recompile them.  NOTE:  it is probably best to use the SMP kernel even in
  a single processor machine if it will run.  The non-SMP kernels should
  really be used only in machines that are not at least a Pentium-Pro, or
  that (for some other reason) will not properly run the SMP kernel.
extra/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.8_2.6.21.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to
  linux-wlan-ng-0.2.8 with modules for Linux 2.6.21.3 (both SMP and non-SMP).
extra/xcdroast:  This has been shuffled off to unsupported, at least for now.
  But before moving it, it was patched for -current and rebuilt with GTK+2.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Comment out /dev/cdrom line in /etc/fstab, as it
  interferes with HAL.  After installing, you'll have to decide if the machine
  will use HAL or not.  If so, rc.hald will have been selected to run during
  the installation (by default it will be off), or chmoded 755 later.  If HAL
  will not be used, the line in /etc/fstab should be uncommented.
  Changed timezone on the installer to GMT-12, so that when the true timezone
  is known at first boot, the filesystems will all have been created and
  last checked in the past.  Added /sbin/sfdisk.
isolinux/{network,pcmcia}.dsk:  Upgraded to 2.6.21.3 modules (thanks Eric!).
kernels/hugesmp.s/*:  Upgraded hugesmp.s kernel to 2.6.21.3 (SMP).
kernels/huge.s/*:  Upgraded huge.s kernel to 2.6.21.3.
kernels/gensmp.s/*:  Upgraded gensmp.s kernel to 2.6.21.3 (SMP).
kernels/generic.s/*:  Upgraded generic.s kernel to 2.6.21.3.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated USB and PXE installers.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
+--------------------------+
Sun May 20 21:40:15 CDT 2007
a/umsdos-progs-1.13-i386-1.tgz:  Removed, since the 2.6.x kernel does not
  support the UMSDOS filesystem.
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed /usr/doc/httpd-2.2.4/ directory.
+--------------------------+
Sat May 19 15:49:00 CDT 2007
a/etc-11.1-noarch-5.tgz:  Added plugdev group (83).  Added apache user and
  group (80).
a/udev-111-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-111.  Thanks to Piter Punk for keeping
  everything in this package working as well as it does.  :-)
d/subversion-1.4.3-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with support for the mod_authz_svn
  and mod_dav_svn modules for httpd-2.2.4 (apache2).
l/pilot-link-0.12.2-i486-3.tgz:  Removed empty /usr/share/pilot-link/udev/.
n/apache-1.3.37-i486-3.tgz:  Removed.
n/bluez-utils-3.9-i486-3.tgz:  Added "restart" to rc.bluetooth, and rewrote it
  to be more like the other Slackware rc.* scripts.
  Chmoded /etc/bluetooth/passkeys/ to mode 700.
  Located the udev related files properly (thanks to Piter Punk).
n/httpd-2.2.4-i486-1.tgz:  The package formerly known as "apache", upgraded
  to httpd-2.2.4.
n/mod_ssl-2.8.28_1.3.37-i486-1.tgz:  Removed, as this is now built into httpd.
n/nfs-utils-1.1.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to nfs-utils-1.1.0.  This no longer
  tries to use "rpc.lockd" (nor contains it), so be sure to upgrade to the new
  versions of the init scripts.  Thanks to Jonathan Woithe for the hint about
  linking with -lnsl after -lwrap, and for passing along a small patch for a
  memory leak in mountd.
n/obexftp-0.21-i486-1.tgz:  Added obexftp-0.21.
n/php-5.2.2-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.2.
n/portmap-6.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to portmap-6.0.
n/wireless-tools-28-i486-5.tgz:  Applied a patch from Eric Hameleers to fix a
  problem reported by Michiel P.H. van Wessem.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Upgraded /sbin/mdadm to version 2.6.1.
+--------------------------+
Wed May 16 15:49:51 CDT 2007
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-9.tgz:  Many reports of problems after
  the last addition of the old trick for flushing disk buffers.  I guess
  if your rc.local needs this sort of thing to avoid trouble at boot, that
  you'd better add it near the beginning of that script.
l/libpng-1.2.18-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libpng-1.2.18.
  A grayscale PNG image with a malformed (bad CRC) tRNS chunk will crash some
  libpng applications.  This vulnerability has been assigned the identifiers
  CVE-2007-2445 and CERT VU#684664.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2445
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Tue May 15 21:50:17 CDT 2007
a/etc-11.1-noarch-4.tgz:  The lack of a shadow entry for "messagebus" was
  bothering some people, so it was added (but it should make no difference).
a/infozip-5.52-i486-2.tgz:  Upgraded zip to version 2.32.  Restored missing
  COPYING.OLD text file (reported by Steffen Wendzel).
a/sysvinit-2.86-i486-5.tgz:  Removed the sysvinit runlevel directories.
a/sysvinit-functions-8.53-i486-2.tgz:  Moved all the non-Slackware-like
  runlevel directories, etc, into this package.  If nothing on your machine
  uses it, it is safe to remove.
  I promised "guru" not to clutter up his machine with these.  :-)
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-8.tgz:  Removed the sysvinit runlevel directories.
  Added a wait/sync/sleep before rc.local to be sure all I/O is done.
  Thanks to Mark for the advice on that.
a/udev-109-i486-3.tgz:  Changed the following serial-type devices to use group
  uucp:  ttyS[0-9]*, ttyUSB[0-9]*, ippp0, isdn*, dcbri*, and ircomm*.
ap/ksh93-2007_03_28-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed incorrect locale file permissions.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.
ap/man-pages-2.48-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to man-pages-2.48.
ap/mt-st-0.9b-i486-2.tgz:  Added mt-st.1.gz -> mt.1.gz symlink.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.
d/git-1.5.1.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to git-1.5.1.4.
l/pilot-link-0.12.2-i486-2.tgz:  Changed udev rules to use group "uucp", which
  has traditionally been the serial device group for Slackware, Red Hat, and
  many other distributions.
n/bluez-utils-3.9-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt with suggestions and addtions from
  the folks at slacky.eu.  Thanks!  :-)
n/net-snmp-5.4-i486-3.tgz:  Added missing /var/lib/net-snmp directory.
  Thanks to Luczak Jacek.
n/netkit-rwho-0.17-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed missing /var/spool/rwho.
  Thanks to Piter Punk.
n/network-scripts-11.1-noarch-3.tgz:  Changed netconfig's method of determining
  if it is running from the installer.  Hopefully it will get it right more
  often now.  :-)  Thanks to Marco Bonetti.
n/openobex-1.3-i486-1.tgz:  Added openobex-1.3.
xap/gnuchess-5.07-i486-3.tgz:  Upgraded to eboard-1.0.3, and applied various
  other fixes provided by Yair K.  Thanks!
extra/ktorrent/ktorrent-2.1.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ktorrent-2.1.4.
extra/linux-2.6.21.1-nosmp-sdk/patch-to-non-smp.sh:  Patched to fix an
  incorrect path to the kernel sources.  Thanks to Michael Gehring.
+--------------------------+
Mon May 14 18:16:10 CDT 2007
a/openssl-solibs-0.9.8e-i486-2.tgz:  Patched a small bug that could cause
  OpenSSL to improperly decrypt older archives.
ap/vim-7.1.001-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.1.001.
n/openssl-0.9.8e-i486-2.tgz:  Patched, recompiled.
n/samba-3.0.25-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-3.0.25.
  Security Fixes included in the Samba 3.0.25 release are:
  o CVE-2007-2444
        Versions: Samba 3.0.23d - 3.0.25pre2
        Local SID/Name translation bug can result in
        user privilege elevation
  o CVE-2007-2446
        Versions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24
        Multiple heap overflows allow remote code execution
  o CVE-2007-2447
        Versions: Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.24
        Unescaped user input parameters are passed as

  (* Security fix *)
xap/vim-gvim-7.1.001-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vim-7.1.001 for GTK+.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Applied patch to /bin/pcmcia to work with Eric's new
  pcmcia.dsk image.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for the patch.
isolinux/pcmcia.dsk:  PCMCIA tools added by Eric Hameleers.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated USB and PXE installers with PCMCIA support.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
+--------------------------+
Fri May 11 17:26:49 CDT 2007
a/bash-3.1.017-i486-2.tgz:  Reverted back to bash-3.1.017 (recompiled).
  bash-3.2 was moved into /testing.  Please see below for the full rationale.
a/cups-1.2.11-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.2.11.
  Only link against OpenSSL, not GnuTLS (as this doesn't add any useful new
  functionality, only new dependencies).  Thanks to Iain Paton for the report.
  Install any new rc.cups (or rc.cups.new) with the same perms as the old one.
a/mkinitrd-1.1.2-i486-1.tgz:  Fixed a bug where modules in the initrd were not
  being replaced with the newer versions in /lib/modules/$(uname -r) if they
  existed on the initrd already.  Changed the load_kernel_modules script to
  use $(uname -r) when loading modules so that the same initrd can be used
  with many different kernels.  Now, -k and -m can be used to add additional
  modules to an initrd without disturbing existing ones.
ap/linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21-i486-4.tgz:  Added asciidoc-8.2.1 and xmlto-0.0.18.
  Upgraded to docbook-4.5 and gtk-doc-1.8.
  Thanks to Stuart Winter for improving Jerome Pinot's original build scripts
  to build from as many original sources as possible, and adding new features.
l/aspell-0.60.5-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against libncursesw to enable utf8.
  Thanks to Tomas Szepe for letting me know aspell was missing utf8 support,
  and about the missing link (see directly below).
l/ncurses-5.6-i486-2.tgz:  Added /usr/include/ncurses -> /usr/include/ncursesw
  symlink.  Thanks to Tomas Szepe for the bug report.
n/epic4-2.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to epic4-2.6.
n/fetchmail-6.3.8-i486-2.tgz:  Fetchmail installed a sample script in the docs
  world-writable.  Fixed.  Thanks to Piter Punk.
n/gnupg2-2.0.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnupg-2.0.4.
n/iputils-s20070202-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
  The iputils SGML -> man pages will build now.  :-)
n/network-scripts-11.1-noarch-2.tgz:  Merged fixes from Eric Hameleers.
  Reduced the default DCHP timeout from 60 to 30 seconds.  Added an example
  of IP aliasing setup to /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf.new.
n/wireless-tools-28-i486-4.tgz:  Applied Eric Hameleers' patch to rc.wireless.
x/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with a patch found on
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9758 by Iain Paton, which
  should fix the issues with X ignoring dpi settings.
x/xorg-server-xdmx-1.3.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/xorg-server-xnest-1.3.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/xorg-server-xvfb-1.3.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to audacious-plugins-1.3.4.
xap/pidgin-2.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  Here's a little excerpt from:
  http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhyPackagesExist
    "We have no developers using Slack, and furthermore, several of us actively
    dislike that distribution for its history of broken installs, as well as
    for its non-existant package management. You cannot create true packages
    for Slack."
  Well, I'm somewhat shocked by this, having never (to my knowledge) done
  anything to any of the former GAIM or Pidgin developers to make them mad at
  me, Slackware, or anyone on the Slackware team.  I guess if they feel it's
  not possible to make a "true" Pidgin package for Slackware, there's no point
  in continuing to try.  Having put out 7 security advisories on GAIM, I'm
  quite sure there will be less work here if Pidgin is not included.
  The Pidgin package has been moved to the "unsupported" directory.  For the
  record, I do not actively dislike Pidgin or any of their developers, but I
  do plan to use Kopete from now on.
xap/xpaint-2.7.8.1-i486-2.tgz:  Moved man page to the correct location.
  Thanks to Dan Church for the bug report.
extra/linux-2.6.21.1-nosmp-sdk:  Added kernel-headers and a patch to easily
  convert from the default SMP Linux source configuration to the non-SMP one.
  If you are running a non-SMP kernel, once you run the script in this
  directory you will be able to easily install software that involves
  compiling kernel modules (such as the binary nVidia drivers).
extra/parted/parted-1.8.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to parted-1.8.7.
isolinux/pcmcia.dsk:  Updated by Eric Hameleers.
testing/packages/bash-3.2.017-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-3.2.017.
  Moved here from slackware/a.  Honestly, I think /testing may be a better
  place for bash-3.2 for a while longer -- it's causing trouble with many old
  scripts.  So, we'll give it a while longer to stabilize and for scripts to
  catch up to any syntax changes which may have occurred.  The fix for 99.9%
  of these old scripts is to not use the deprecated `command` syntax and
  instead use the $(command) syntax.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated USB and PXE installers.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
+--------------------------+
Wed May  9 00:16:20 CDT 2007
extra/slackpkg/slackpkg-2.60-noarch-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to slackpkg-2.60.  Thanks to Piter Punk.

a/gzip-1.3.12-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gzip-1.3.12.
a/lilo-22.8-i486-2.tgz:  Removed device-mapper/lvm2 support until we have
  new versions of both of these that will compile with this kernel.
l/libxml2-2.6.28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libxml2-2.6.28.
n/curl-7.16.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to curl-7.16.2.
n/fetchmail-6.3.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to fetchmail-6.3.8.
  Added "fetchmail is probably not secure" to slack-desc.  When we've seldom
  had a Slackware release that didn't need a fetchmail security advisory
  before the next Slackware was out, I think that's fair to say.
  (* Security fix *)
n/getmail-4.7.4-noarch-1.tgz:  A secure python-based fetchmail alternative.
n/gnutls-1.6.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnutls-1.6.2.
n/links-2.1pre28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to links-2.1pre28.
n/netkit-ntalk-0.17-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed build script and slack-desc.
  Thanks to Steffen Wendzel.
n/ntp-4.2.4p0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ntp-4.2.4p0.
  Thanks to Mikhail Ulanov for configuration and scripting help.
n/php-4.4.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-4.4.7.
  This fixes bugs and improves security.

xap/xchat-2.8.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xchat-2.8.2.
extra/php5/php-5.2.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.2.
  This fixes bugs and improves security.
  For more details, see:

a/kernel-modules-smp-2.6.21.1_smp-i686-2.tgz:  Patched SiS 900 driver that was
  causing system crashes.  Thanks to Michael Wagner, Paolo Segre, Piter Punk,
  and Jens Odsvall for reporting the problem.  Usually I'd say to report it to
  the kernel people, but it's already in GIT and I'll make an exception this
  time about patching the kernel here.  :-)
d/kernel-headers-2.6.21.1_smp-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt.
a/mkinitrd-1.1.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded mkinitrd to 1.1.1.  Thanks to Piter Punk
  for the patch to resolve kernel module dependencies automatically.  :-)
ap/dvd+rw-tools-7.0-i486-2.tgz:  Applied a couple of patches needed to burn
  with 2.6.21.x kernels with some burners.  Thanks to Fedora.  ;-)
ap/mdadm-2.6.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mdadm-2.6.1.
k/kernel-source-2.6.21.1_smp-noarch-2.tgz:  Patched SiS 900 driver.
+--------------------------+
Sat May  5 14:09:30 CDT 2007
xap/pidgin-2.0.0-i486-2.tgz:  My Pidgin build script left a couple "droppings"
  in the / directory.  Thanks to all those who reported this.
+--------------------------+
Fri May  4 21:21:56 CDT 2007
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-7.tgz:  Added back calls to start/stop rc.pcmcia.
  Thanks to alemao for the bug report.

Mon Apr 30 01:35:44 CDT 2007
a/pcmciautils-014-i486-3.tgz:  Merged patches from Piter Punk.
a/sysvinit-functions-8.53-i486-1.tgz:  Split the RH-like functions and the
  supporting binaries out into a new package.  /etc/init.d/functions now
  requires no patching to work on Slackware.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-6.tgz:  Removed "functions" and /etc/init.d/
  symbolic link.  Thanks to Giacomo Picconi for pointing out how the
  /etc/init.d/ symlink could wipe out existing scripts.
ap/mc-4.6.1_20070309-i486-2.tgz:  Changed from --with-x=no to --with-x=yes.
  MC can now load X support dynamically without requiring a hard link (or
  dependency) on any of the X packages.  This gives better keyboard support
  in an xterm.  Thanks to Andrey V. Panov for telling me about this.
a/udev-109-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-109.  Thanks to Piter Punk!
  Added /dev/ttyUSB* symlinks.  Thanks to giovanni quadriglio.

n/netkit-rwho-0.17-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/netkit-timed-0.17-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/net-snmp-5.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed a bug in the build script where cat was used
  instead of zcat to install a compressed config file.  Oddly, the -1 package
  seems to be OK though (the config file is not compressed).
  Thanks to Jacek Luczak for the bug report.
  Added --without-rpm to the ./configure list.  Thanks to Stuart Winter.
n/network-scripts-11.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/netwrite-0.17-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/tcp_wrappers-7.6-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/tcpip-0.17-i486-39.tgz:  Removed.  (split into tiny little pieces)
n/telnet-0.17-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.
n/tftp-hpa-0.48-i486-1.tgz:  Split from old tcpip package.

x/xf86-video-ati-6.6.3-i486-3.tgz:  Dropped back to xf86-video-ati-6.6.3 after
  more reports of signal 11 crashes at boot and general instability in the
  newer driver.  The newer one is reported to be faster, though.  :-)
xap/gnuplot-4.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnuplot-4.2.0.
+--------------------------+
Mon Apr 23 20:41:35 CDT 2007
a/cxxlibs-6.0.8-i486-3.tgz:  Added back libstdc++-3-libc6.2-2-2.10.0.so, which
  seems to be needed by a lot of binaries floating around.
a/isapnptools-1.26-i486-2.tgz:  Patched for newer kernels and recompiled.
a/lilo-22.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lilo-22.8.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-5.tgz:  Make a symlink /etc/init.d ->
  /etc/rc.d/rc.init.d, since that's where many things expect to find the
  "functions" script.  Thanks to Catalin Tomozei for the report.
  In rc.M, move fc-cache further up and background the process.
ap/nano-2.0.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to nano-2.0.5.
d/strace-4.5.15-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to strace-4.5.15.

  encoding in KMail.
kdei/koffice-l10n-km-1.6.2-noarch-1a.tgz:  Fixed empty slack-desc.
x/ttf-indic-fonts-0.4.7.4-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ttf-indic-fonts-0.4.7.4.
+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 22 14:04:37 CDT 2007
a/etc-11.1-noarch-3.tgz:  In ld.so.conf, remove /usr/X11R6/lib to prevent it
  from showing up in ldd paths.  Thanks to TJ Nardi for the report.
  Removed /usr/X11R6/bin from the $PATH.
l/freetype-2.3.4-i486-3.tgz:  Evidently unless
  TT_CONFIG_OPTION_UNPATENTED_HINTING is undefined the bytecode interpreter
  will remain disabled even if TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER is defined.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for the new patch.
extra/jdk-6/jdk-6u1-i586-1.tgz:  Some of the mirrors got a corrupted copy of
  this package, so I've touched the files to push them out to the mirrors again.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Updated USB and PXE installers.
  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
+--------------------------+
Sat Apr 21 15:19:04 CDT 2007
kde/amarok-1.4.5-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.
kde/kdeaccessibility-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.
kde/kdeaddons-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.

kde/kdeartwork-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.
kde/kdebase-3.5.6-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.
  Added a symlink from /etc/X11/kdm to /etc/kde/kdm.
  In /etc/profile.d/kde.*sh, set XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to contain /etc/kde/xdg (plus
  /etc/xdg and any previously set $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS).  This avoids a problem
  when several desktops use /etc/xdg for XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and files may get
  overwritten.  Although /etc/xdg is defined as the default XDG config dir,
  nothing should really use it or collision problems may occur.
  Thanks to Gyula for pointing out this issue.

kde/koffice-1.6.2-i486-5.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/kde.
l/arts-1.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled.
l/freetype-2.3.4-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed bytecode interpreter patch and added a
  subpixel rendering patch.  Note that these are disabled by default
  because they use methods which are patented by Apple and Microsoft.
  Do not enable them unless you have obtained the required licenses.
l/jre-6u1-i586-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard Edition
  Runtime Environment Version 6.0 update 1.
x/xf86-video-ati-6.6.191-i486-2.tgz:  This seems to work without any noticable
  delays or other problems here now that we're using xorg-server-1.3.0.0, so
  we'll give it another try.
x/xf86-video-intel-2.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-video-intel-2.0.0.
x/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.3.0.0.

xap/xfce-4.4.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with --sysconfdir=/etc/xfce.
  In /etc/profile.d/xfce.*sh, set XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to contain /etc/xfce/xdg
  (plus /etc/xdg and any previously set $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS).
xap/xscreensaver-5.02-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xscreensaver-5.02.

  Thanks to Stuart Winter.
+--------------------------+
Thu Apr 19 18:34:58 CDT 2007
kde/k3b-1.0.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-1.0.1.  Moved into main tree now
  that k3b is no longer trying to make cdrecord setuid root.  :-)
kdei/k3b-i18n-1.0.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-i18n-1.0.1.
x/xf86-video-ati-6.6.3-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt the xf86-video-ati as I've gotten
  sereral signal 11 crash reports on the 6.6.191, but none on 6.6.3.  On my
  Radeon 9600 here the 6.6.191 shuts off the signal to the monitor for a few
  seconds before continuing, but doesn't crash.  The 6.6.3 version doesn't do
  this.  Anyway, if I'm causing more trouble here than I'm fixing, let me know.
x/xf86-video-nv-2.0.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-video-nv-2.0.2.
xap/blackbox-0.65.0-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed zero length xinitrc.blackbox.
  Thanks to arny and Michiel P.H. van Wessem for reporting the bug.
xap/fluxbox-1.0rc3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to fluxbox-1.0rc3.
xap/gimp-2.2.14-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-2.2.14.

+--------------------------+
Thu Apr 19 10:58:08 CDT 2007
a/mkinitrd-1.1.0-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed sed substitutions in README.initrd.
  Thanks to Tsomi.
kde/kdebase-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed an Xsession bug when using tcsh.
  Thanks to Jim Diamond.
  Patched a bug in the nsplugin keyboard handler.
xap/xine-lib-1.1.6-i686-2.tgz:  Deleted extra junk from the docs directory.
  Thanks to Tsomi.
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 18 14:27:40 CDT 2007
l/svgalib-1.9.25_2.6.18.8_smp-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
extra/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.7_2.6.18.8_smp-i486-1.tgz:
  Recompiled.
+--------------------------+
Wed Apr 18 13:32:53 CDT 2007
ap/hplip-1.7.3-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled, actually *linking* with net-snmp.
  Thanks to my fellow slacker David Somero for pointing this one out.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Updated kernel modules.
isolinux/network.dsk:  Updated kernel modules.
+--------------------------+
Tue Apr 17 22:27:54 CDT 2007
xap/xine-lib-1.1.6-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xine-lib-1.1.6.
  Thanks to Shin-ichi Abe for pointing this out so quickly.  :-)
+--------------------------+
Tue Apr 17 18:16:29 CDT 2007
a/dialog-1.1_20070409-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dialog-1.1-20070409.
  Added wide character support (suggested by Valentin Stoykov).
a/kernel-generic-2.6.18.8_smp-i686-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP generic.s (requires initrd) kernel to use CFQ
  I/O scheduling by default.  Also not that this kernel NO LONGER has ext2
  built into it, and ext3 requires an additional module.
  See below in the mkinitrd comments.
a/kernel-huge-2.6.18.8_smp-i686-2.tgz:
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP huge.s (full-featured) kernel.
a/kernel-modules-2.6.18.8_smp-i686-2.tgz
  Recompiled Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP kernel modules.
a/mkinitrd-1.1.0-i486-1.tgz:  Use an initramfs instead of an initrd.  This
  allows making the ext2 filesystem as a module in the generic kernel.
  NOTE:  Because of changes to the kernel options, *everyone* using an initrd
  must rebuild it!  And, ext3 requires an additional module:  mbcache:jbd:ext3
a/sysvinit-2.86-i486-4.tgz:  Patched killall5 (pidof) to add feature from the
  RH fork...
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-4.tgz:  Moved /etc/init.d/functions here, as it
  may need work more often than originally thought.
  Removed /initrd directory stuff from rc.S and rc.6.
ap/hplip-1.7.3-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with net-snmp.  I saw it go by during
  ./configure, but having no test devices I'll need some feedback to know if
  this gets HP network printers supported.
ap/ksh93-2007_03_28-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ksh93-2007_03_28.
d/kernel-headers-2.6.18.8_smp-i386-2.tgz:
  Regenerated Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP kernel headers.
f/linux-howtos-20070412-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Linux-HOWTOs-20070412.
k/kernel-source-2.6.18.8_smp-noarch-2.tgz:
  Rebuilt Linux 2.6.18.8 SMP kernel source package with new .config.
kde/kdegraphics-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against poppler.
kde/kdepim-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against pilot-link-0.12.1.
kde/koffice-1.6.2-i486-4.tgz:  Recompiled against poppler.
l/freetype-2.3.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to freetype-2.3.4.
  Fixed an overflow parsing BDF fonts.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1351
  (* Security fix *)
l/pilot-link-0.12.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pilot-link-0.12.1.
l/poppler-0.5.4-i486-1.tgz:  Added poppler-0.5.4.
l/poppler-data-0.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Added poppler-data-0.1.
l/sdl-1.2.11-i486-3.tgz:  Patched SDL_ttf for new freetype.
l/vte-0.16.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled to fix a broken libvte.la.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
n/net-snmp-5.4-i486-1.tgz:  Added net-snmp.  This is needed for HP's network
  printers, but will probably find other uses as well.
x/fontconfig-2.4.2-i486-2.tgz:  Removed 10-autohint.conf symlink.
  Thanks to Laurence Darby and Darrell Anderson.  
  Index all default directories in /usr/share/fonts except for 75dpi and
  100dpi (as this makes X prefer bitmapped fonts in some cases where scaled
  fonts look much nicer).
  Thanks to Lukasz Derkacz -- sorry to render your name into ASCII  ;-)
x/libXdamage-1.1.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libXdamage-1.1.1.
x/libXi-1.0.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libXi-1.0.4.
x/x11-skel-7.1-noarch-4.tgz:  Added /etc/xdg -> /etc/X11/xdg symlink.
  Thanks to Jerome Pinot for pointing out that the web page describing the
  XDG_CONFIG_DIRS environment variable states that the default is /etc/xdg
  unless something else is set.  (Hmmm... things are installing themselves
  to the wrong place without help ;-)
x/xf86-input-keyboard-1.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-input-keyboard-1.2.0.
  Thanks to Andrzej Szelachowski for noticing that libXdamage and
  xf86-input-keyboard were not the latest versions.
xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to audacious-plugins-1.3.3.
xap/gkrellm-2.2.10-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed /usr/local path in gkrellm.pc.
xap/x3270-3.3.5-i486-2.tgz:  Moved fonts directly into /usr/share/fonts/misc.
  Thanks to "guru" for noticing that they were following a symlink.
xap/xfce-4.4.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to XFce-4.4.1.
xap/xine-lib-1.1.5-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xine-lib-1.1.5.
  This fixes overflows in some little-used media formats.  These overflows
  could definitely cause an application using xine-lib to crash, and it is
  theorized that a malicious media file could be made to run arbitrary code
  in the context of the user running the application.
  (* Security fix *)
xap/xpdf-3.02-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xpdf-3.02.
  Removed the command-line utilities that are present in poppler.
kernels/generic.s/*:  Recompiled generic.s kernel to 2.6.18.8 (SMP).
kernels/huge.s/*:  Recompiled huge.s kernel to 2.6.18.8 (SMP).
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Upgraded USB and PXE installers from Eric Hameleers.
+--------------------------+
Tue Apr 10 16:57:30 CDT 2007
a/aaa_base-11.1.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Added /srv directory.
  After backing up any real /usr/X11R6, create a compatibility symlink tree
  to support all the software out there that'll be looking for /usr/X11R6
  5 years from now.
a/cpio-2.5-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.  Newer versions break initramfs in the
  2.6.18.x kernels, so we'll still have to wait on an upgrade...
  Fixed broken manpages.  Thanks for the reports from Tsomi and Lilong Li.
a/sysklogd-1.4.1-i486-10.tgz:  Patched to compile with gcc4.  Made the
  syslogd/klogd race handling script (hopefully) faster.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-3.tgz:  Moved ldconfig up to near the top of
  rc.M and '&'ed it, which should be safe enough.
  Moved clockset to earlier in rc.S to avoid the "last mounted in the future"
  message from fsck seen by people keeping the local time (rather than UTC) in
  the hardware clock in certain timezones.  Thanks to Darrell Anderson for
  reporting this and providing a fix.
ap/bc-1.06.95-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bc-1.06.95, since the old bc won't
  compile with a recent flex.  This version tests faster, too.
ap/espgs-8.15.4-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled to let altertrack handle gziping and
  symlinking the manpages.
ap/hplip-1.7.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hplip-1.7.3.
ap/lm_sensors-2.10.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lm_sensors-2.10.3.
ap/mc-4.6.1_20070309-i486-1.tgz:  Patched with mc-4.6.1-2007-03-09-18 to fix
  various bugs.  Thanks to Markus Kanet and Eugene Bogoroditskiy for pointing
  out the patch.  The bug of being unable to cd to a directory containing '_'
  was also reported by Tomas Matejicek and Richard Hoyle.
ap/nano-2.0.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to nano-2.0.4.
ap/screen-4.0.3-i486-1.tgz:  Recompiled.
ap/zsh-4.3.2-i486-2.tgz:  Don't clobber an existing /etc/zprofile.
  Thanks to Stanislaw Klekot.
d/flex-2.5.33-i486-3.tgz:  Added lex -> flex symlink.  Thanks to Luigi.
d/ruby-1.8.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ruby-1.8.6.
kde/kdebindings-3.5.6-i486-4.tgz:  Fixed DCOP.3 manpage (hopefully for good).
l/atk-1.18.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to atk-1.18.0.
l/cairo-1.4.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cairo-1.4.2.
l/glib2-2.12.11-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glib-2.12.11.
l/gtk+2-2.10.11-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gtk+2-2.10.11.
l/pango-1.16.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pango-1.16.1.
l/readline-5.2-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with readline52-002 patch.
  Added --enable-multibyte option.
l/vte-0.16.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to vte-0.16.1.
n/apache-1.3.37-i486-3.tgz:  Added /srv/www -> /var/www symlink.
n/htdig-3.2.0b6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to htdig-3.2.0b6.
n/proftpd-1.3.0a-i486-1.tgz:  Recompiled.
x/libXfont-1.2.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libXfont-1.2.8.
x/x11-skel-7.1-noarch-3.tgz:  Fixed /usr/X11 symlink.
  Backup any old /usr/X11R6 and create an empty /usr/X11R6 (though there
  should already be one made by aaa_base and populated with backwards
  compatibility symlinks).  A renaming of this package to "aaa_x11" is
  under consideration...
x/xf86-video-ati-6.6.191-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-video-ati-6.6.191.
x/xorg-server-1.2.99.905-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.2.99.905.

xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to audacious-plugins-1.3.2.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Switch back to ash to see if this has any bearing on
  "currupt package" install failures on SMP machines.
+--------------------------+
Thu Apr  5 14:33:11 CDT 2007
ap/dvd+rw-tools-7.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dvd+rw-tools-7.0, needed by
  k3b-1.0.  Thanks to the many who pointed this out.
+--------------------------+
Tue Apr  3 15:57:41 CDT 2007
a/aaa_base-11.1.0-noarch-3.tgz:  Removed /usr/etc directory.
a/cups-1.2.10-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.2.10.
a/etc-11.1-noarch-2.tgz:  Removed /usr/etc/printcap symlink.  I don't think
  anything has used this in years, but let me know if something still wants it.
a/file-4.20-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to file-4.20.
  This fixes a heap overflow that could allow code to be executed as the
  user running file (note that there are many scenarios where file might be
  used automatically, such as in virus scanners or spam filters).
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1536
  (* Security fix *)
a/sysvinit-2.86-i486-3.tgz:  In functions, change usleep calls to sleep calls.

ap/espgs-8.15.4-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to espgs-8.15.4.
ap/zsh-4.3.2-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to zsh-4.3.2.
d/gdb-6.6-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled against new libexpat.
  Thanks to Giacomo Lozito for noticing this last link to the past.
d/m4-1.4.9-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to m4-1.4.9.
kde/kdelibs-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled with a patch to kjs.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
  Thanks to Giacomo Lozito for the heads-up on this one as well.
kde/kdegraphics-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
kde/kdesdk-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.

  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.

  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
kde/kdebindings-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
kde/kdegames-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.

  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
kde/kdenetwork-3.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
kde/kdevelop-3.4.0-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.

  Changed --sysconfdir from /usr/etc to /etc/X11.
l/arts-1.5.6-i486-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
l/libmikmod-3.1.11a-i486-2.tgz:  Removed.  There's better libmikmod support in
  audacious-plugins, and after XMMS's removal nothing in Slackware was using
  this library any longer.
l/qt-3.3.8-i486-3.tgz:  Patched an issue where the Qt UTF 8 decoder may in some
  instances fail to reject overlong sequences, possibly allowing "/../" path
  injection or XSS errors.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0242
  (* Security fix *)
  Also, restored /usr/lib/qt/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf fixing "make xconfig" in
  the kernel.  Thanks to all those who reported this issue.
l/slang-2.0.7-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to slang-2.0.7, moved --sysconfig to /etc.
l/svgalib-1.9.25_2.6.18.8_smp-i486-2.tgz:  Changed to slacktrack for build
  method, as the SlackBuild method was embedding some incorrect paths.
n/openldap-client-2.3.32-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openldap-2.3.32 client libs.
n/openssh-4.6p1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-4.6p1.  Changed rc.sshd
  slightly to avoid the potential to be disconnected from a remote box without
  sshd being restarted when using "sh /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd restart".
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
x/compiz-0.5.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to compiz-0.5.0.
x/libX11-1.1.1-i486-3.tgz:  Restored XCB support after being informed of some
  benchmarks that show a significant performance increase.
x/libxcb-1.0-i486-2.tgz:  Patched to work around the locking problem that was
  affecting Java and other programs.  I would have preferred to hold out for a
  new release of libxcb, but we can see what happens with this for now.
  Thanks to Luigi Genoni for convincing me to try this patch.
x/xf86-input-joystick-1.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-input-joystick-1.2.0.
x/xf86-video-intel-1.9.94-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xf86-video-intel-1.9.94.

x/xorg-server-1.2.99.903-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.2.99.903.
x/xorg-server-xdmx-1.2.99.903-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.2.99.903.
x/xorg-server-xnest-1.2.99.903-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.2.99.903.
x/xorg-server-xvfb-1.2.99.903-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xorg-server-1.2.99.903.
xap/audacious-plugins-1.3.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled using --enable-chardet.
xap/audacious-1.3.1-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled using --enable-chardet instead of
  the incorrect --enable-charset.
xap/gqview-2.1.5-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed non-Slackware-compliant slack-desc: (not 11
  info lines, missing editing instructions/ruler, "GQview" improperly
  capitalized, top line should have the Slackware package name followed by
  the (description), and "empty" lines shouldn't have whitespace after the ":".
  Thanks to Selkfoster for pointing out the first of these minor issues.
xap/pan-0.126-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pan-0.126.
xap/x3270-3.3.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to x3270-3.3.5.  Moved config file from
  /usr/etc/x3270/ to /etc/X11/x3270/ and added config() installation.
extra/k3b/k3b-1.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-1.0.
extra/k3b/k3b-i18n-1.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to k3b-i18n-1.0.
extra/ktorrent/ktorrent-2.1.3-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ktorrent-2.1.3.
  A directory traversal vulnerability in torrent.cpp in versions < 2.1.2 may
  allow remote attackers to overwrite the ktorrent user's files.  A bug in
  chunkcounter.cpp in versions < 2.1.2 allows remote attackers to crash
  ktorrent and cause heap corruption by the use of an invalid idx value.

Mon Mar 26 20:58:57 CDT 2007
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-2.tgz:  Added an '&&' in the /tmp cleanup
  section to avoid an (unlikely) catastrophe.  Thanks to J.
  Flushed out a few more X11R6 paths (and I know there are more...)
x/compiz-0.3.6-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled with KDE and SVG support.  This was
  suggested by many and added to the configure options, and then I forgot to
  recompile.  Sorry about that.  Also, I'm really not sure if this requires
  the Xgl server (which isn't, to my knowledge, yet in a xorg-server tarball
  release).  Just starting to get my feet wet with this compositing stuff.  :-)
x/xf86-video-nv-1.99.1-i486-1.tgz:  Dropped back from 2.0.0 after numerous
  reports of this update causing X to hang with a black screen at start.  I'd
  hoped this driver would get my recent onboard chipset working, but no go.
  Didn't get the black-screen-hang though -- instead it was the same as before.
  The top half of the desktop stretched to fill the screen...
xap/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.3-i686-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.3.
  This upgrade fixes several possible security bugs.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox
  NOTE:  If a security issue affects *only* -current, the ChangeLog may be the
  only place an announcement is made.  Just a friendly heads-up, though in this
  case you'll be seeing updates and an advisory due to Firefox in 11.0.
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 24 18:57:38 CDT 2007
d/pmake-1.111-i486-3.tgz:  Patched util.c to get pmake to compile again.
  As nothing was changed but a chmod in the build script, this one is a
  bit puzzling, but it's working again.  Thanks to Jerome Pinot for
  noticing the main binary had vanished from the package.  :-)
x/xf86-video-intel-1.9.91-i486-1.tgz:  Dropped back to .91, as .92 needs
  a function that hasn't shown up yet (might be in some CVS HEAD) and
  thus doesn't work.  Hopefully 93 will.
usb-and-pxe-installers/:  Upgraded to Eric Hameleers' latest versions of
  these installers that include the recent (c)fdisk fixes from the last
  batch of updates.
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar 24 01:32:30 CDT 2007
a/bash-3.2.015-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-3.2 patchlevel 015.

  Thanks to Tomas Matejicek.

d/pmake-1.111-i486-2.tgz:  Fixed perms on /usr/share/mk.
  Thanks to Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi for noticing this.

x/ttf-indic-fonts-0.4.7.1-noarch-3.tgz:  Fixed mkfont{scale,dir} order.
x/libX11-1.1.1-i486-2.tgz:  Rebuilt with --with-xcb=no, which fixes the issues
  reported with Java programs.  I figure if this impacted Java, it might stir
  things up elsewhere as well, so rather than patch XCB or wait for a new Java
  (it's fixed there too, in the Java repo), we'll take the conservative path
  for now.
x/makedepend-1.0.1-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to makedepend-1.0.1.
x/mkfontdir-1.0.3-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mkfontdir-1.0.3.
  Fixed after-fresh-install script to run mkfontscale and then mkfontdir.
  Moved after-fresh-install script before fc-cache.
  Thanks to Petri Kaukasoina for teaching me the correct order for these.

isolinux/initrd.img:  Fixed cfdisk and fdisk, which were supposed to be scripts
  to call the real binaries and then create /dev nodes for anything added.
+--------------------------+
Mon Mar 19 21:05:46 CDT 2007
Fixed the mysteriously incorrect mozilla packages.
There are also a couple other known-stale (_slack11.0) packages.

Sun Mar 18 12:14:49 CDT 2007

  Happy St. Patrick's Day!  :-)
  This is more-or-less stable (functionally), but there's still a lot of
  package splitting and other rearranging and adding to be done, but it's
  time for the Slackware community to see how far we've gotten.  If the
  luck o' the Irish is with us, it'll be a fairly short alpha/beta/rc
  period from here.  Well, have fun!
  A couple notes:
  1. The only kernels provided (for now) support SMP.  I've seen the
     installer go nuts on a few machines with multiple cores where a
     uniprocessor core worked fine.  More kernel choices will very
     likely be added.
  2. Floppy booting (other than via PXE) is likely gone for good, but
     between PXE and USB flash memory boot, (along with the standard
     ISO boot), most machines should be covered.
  3. This is still a work in progress, so don't be too hard on us.  ;-)
a/kernel-generic-2.6.18.8_smp-i486-1.tgz:

a/etc-11.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Added a .xsession in /etc/skel to run gpg-agent,
  but it will only end up running under incredibly rare circumstances
  with the way the various X startup scripts are designed.  I'm looking
  for a better way to start gpg-agent automagically.
  Added messagebus uid/gid (81).

+--------------------------+
Thu Feb 22 01:10:51 CST 2007
a/cpio-2.5-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled.  Newer versions break initramfs in the
  2.6.18.x kernels, so we'll have to wait on an upgrade.
a/cups-1.2.8-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cups-1.2.8.
a/kernel-generic-2.6.18.7_smp-i486-1.tgz:

  Thanks to Robby Workman for help with the build script!
a/udev-104-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to udev-104.  Thanks again to Piter Punk for
  doing the work on this.  :-)  Also, please be sure if you plan to use the
  new sysvinit, sysvinit-scripts, and udev packages that you upgradepkg all of
  them, and that you search-and-handle any *.new files under /etc.  I know that
  goes without saying for most of us old-timers, but it never hurts to add a
  reminder when the result otherwise would be crash and burn..
ap/cdrtools-2.01.01a23-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cdrtools-2.01.01a23.

xap/xine-ui-0.99.4-i686-4.tgz:  Recompiled.  This lost libcaca support, at
  least for a while...

  Thanks again to Piter Punk for the help.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Removed old deprecated raidtools, added /sbin/mdadm.
  Generally updated everything to use -current tools.
extra/slacktrack/slacktrack-1.30-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to slacktrack-1.30_1.
  Thanks to Stuart Winter for the new version!
kernels/generic.s/*:  Upgraded generic.s kernel to 2.6.18.7 (SMP).
kernels/huge.s/*:  Upgraded huge.s kernel to 2.6.18.7 (SMP).
pasture/gcc-3.4.6/*:  Moved to pasture as some things still aren't ready for
  gcc-4, such as espgs.
pasture/raidtools-1.00.3-i386-1.tgz:  Moved to /pasture.  Use mdadm.  :-)
pasture/xfm-1.4.3-i486-2.tgz:  Recompiled, moved to /pasture.  I doubt many
  people use this anymore...  it made history as one of the first file managers
  available for Linux, but there are better choices today.

kde/amarok-1.4.5-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to amarok-1.4.5.
  Now linked with libkarma, but you'll have to get the omfs kernel module.  :-)
  Note:  KDE is now being built with --prefix=/usr, not --prefix=/opt/kde.
  This makes it much easier to follow freedesktop.org's recommendations for
  unifying the various Linux desktops.  IMO, now that X.Org has made 
  --prefix=/usr the standard for X11, this is an obviously better place for
  KDE and XFce (which was always there ;-), too.

  overwrite any of the user's files (in the case of root, any file on the
  system).

applicable, but left the _slack11.0 tag on them since we'll be rebuilding
just about everything anyway.
ap/screen-4.0.3-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to screen-4.0.3.
  This addresses an issue with the way screen handles UTF-8 character encoding
  that could allow screen to be crashed (or possibly code to be executed in the
  context of the screen user) if a specially crafted sequence of pseudo-UTF-8
  characters are displayed withing a screen session.

kde/qt-3.3.7-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to qt-x11-free-3.3.7.
  This fixes an issue with Qt's handling of pixmap images that causes Qt linked
  applications to crash if a specially crafted malicious image is loaded.
  Inspection of the code in question makes it seem unlikely that this could
  lead to more serious implications (such as arbitrary code execution), but it
  is recommended that users upgrade to the new Qt package.

n/bind-9.3.2_P2-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.3.2-P2.  This fixes some security issues related to
  previous fixes in OpenSSL.  The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to
  OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws
  in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you
  have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable
  security problem in named.  In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed
  from 3 to 65537.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously BIND's
  default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging
  of RRSIGs.

Thanks to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the question below.  It
looks as if Slackware -current (future 12.0?) is going to charge into 2.6-only
territory, but it will be a conservative "charge".  :-)  The overwhelming
consensus is that the 2.6 series is now more than stable enough for production
use.  Some folks expressed concern over the loss of Linux 2.4.x compatibility,
but they were a definite minority.  Some suggested maintaining two -current
branches -- one following 2.4 and the other 2.6.  The solution that'll be
taken concerning 2.4.x will be to make Slackware 11.0 better maintained than
simply security updates.  It should see some other non-security updates as
well (perhaps the introduction of an /updates directory?), and will be a long
lived OS for those who swear by the stability of the 2.4.x kernel series.
Meanwhile, 2.4.x compatibility features (such as the, er, mess? going on in
the startup scripts) will be steadily eliminated in -current to focus on the
best possible 2.6.x support.  With a lot of work, we should be able to make
the next Slackware release an excellent choice for both servers and desktops.
Again -- thanks for all the input!  :-)
+--------------------------+
Thu Nov  9 18:16:50 CST 2006
Q:  Hey, what's the deal with -current?
A:  Renovations are underway to the toolchain (gcc, glibc, binutils, etc),
    and it makes little sense to update what is essentially Slackware 11.0
    only to do the work all over again once the new toolchain is ready.
    In addition, these things aren't going as smoothly as anticipated.
    I'd like to put the NPTL version of glibc into /lib and the LinuxThreads
    version into /lib/obsolete/linuxthreads (since some old binaries are
    going to need them), but doing this prevents the use of a 2.4 kernel.
    Perhaps it's finally time to drop support for Linux 2.4?  Personally,
    I'd rather not as 2.4 is more forgiving of flaky hardware and thus
    tends to get better uptimes (at least on the servers I run ;-).
    Comments about this issue are welcomed.
    glibc-2.5 has also been having some problems with locale support here
    that need to be investigated and dealt with.  I'd rather base the glibc
    in Slackware on an official glibc release, but using the development
    repo is also something under (slight) consideration if it works better.

extra/mozilla-firefox-2.0/mozilla-firefox-2.0-i686-1.tgz:  Moved from /patches,
  since it was pointed out that this sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use the libraries
  in /usr/lib/firefox-2.0/ which aren't compatible with the SeaMonkey libraries
  that are used to compile the gxine plugin, breaking it.  I'm currently
  looking for a workaround for this issue, but meanwhile using firefox-1.5.0.8
  with the gxine plugin works just fine.  Honestly, I hadn't expected to see
  another firefox-1.x release once 2.0 came out or I might not have added it to
  Slackware 11.0 after the release...

  default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging
  of RRSIGs.

extra/php5/php-5.2.0-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-5.2.0.
  This release "includes a large number of new features, bug fixes and security
  enhancements."  In particular, when the UTF-8 charset is selected there are
  buffer overflows in the htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities() that may be
  exploited to execute arbitrary code.
  More details about the vulnerability may be found here:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5465
  Further details about the release can be found in the release announcement:
    http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_0.php
  Some syntax has changed since PHP 5.1.x.  An upgrading guide may be found at
  this location:
    http://www.php.net/UPDATE_5_2.txt
  This package was placed in /extra rather than /patches to save people from
  possible surprises with automated upgrade tools, since users of PHP4 and
  PHP 5.1.x applications may need to make some code changes before things will
  work again.

patches/packages/php-4.4.4-i486-4_slack11.0.tgz:  Patched the UTF-8 overflow.
  More details about the vulnerability may be found here:

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/screen-4.0.3-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to screen-4.0.3.
  This addresses an issue with the way screen handles UTF-8 character encoding
  that could allow screen to be crashed (or possibly code to be executed in the
  context of the screen user) if a specially crafted sequence of pseudo-UTF-8
  characters are displayed withing a screen session.

patches/packages/mozilla-firefox-2.0-i686-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to Mozilla Firefox 2.0.  This is a completely optional enhanced
  feature package update.  Usually I'd reserve this space only for security
  patches (which this is not), but Firefox 2.0 is just so cool that I couldn't
  resist upgrading it, especially with Slackware 11.0 so recently released.

patches/packages/qca-tls-1.0-i486-3_slack11.0.tgz:  Rebuilt to place the plugin
  in /usr/lib/qt-3.3.7/plugins/crypto/.
patches/packages/qt-3.3.7-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:  Upgraded to qt-x11-free-3.3.7.
  This fixes an issue with Qt's handling of pixmap images that causes Qt linked
  applications to crash if a specially crafted malicious image is loaded.
  Inspection of the code in question makes it seem unlikely that this could
  lead to more serious implications (such as arbitrary code execution), but it
  is recommended that users upgrade to the new Qt package.

Slackware 11.0 is released.  Thanks to everyone who helped out and made this
release possible.  If I forgot you in the ChangeLog, mea culpa, but you know
who you are, and thanks.  :-)
Enjoy!  -P.
