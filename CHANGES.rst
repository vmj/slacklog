Release history
===============


Version 0.9.5 (2018-10-02)
--------------------------

This release adds the JSON formatter.

As for dependencies, support for Python 3.3 was dropped since it had it's end-of-life a year ago. Also, dateutil 2.7 is
tested to be good.


Version 0.9.4 (2017-09-03)
--------------------------

The parser subclass can now overwrite the generation of entry identifier and/or checksum.

Other than that, tests were updated to use python-dateutil 2.6.1, and documentation was fixed.


Version 0.9.3 (2017-08-23)
--------------------------

This release is mainly bug fixing.  RSS and atom formatters learnt to take
the feed build time (optionally) as an argument, which makes them more testable.


Version 0.9.2 (2017-05-25)
--------------------------

This release is backwards incompatible with the previous releases:
SlackLogParser and SlackLogFormatter (and subclasses) have to be instantiated,
and instead of using class methods, instance methods and properties have to be used.

--------------------------

This release adds checksum, identifier, and parent fields to SlackLogEntry.

Verions 0.9.0 (2017-04-05)
--------------------------

changes in the CLI).


Version 0.0.9 (2017-04-04)
--------------------------

This release does not add any new functionality.

The dependencies were updated: Python 2.7, 3.3 - 3.6, and python-dateutil 2.1 - 2.6.
Support for Python 2.6 was dropped, not because it doesn't work but because Python core team doesn't support it.

14.2.


Version 0.0.8 (2014-09-28)
--------------------------
